All I could think of is, ""dude, don't put that 130 year old baby in that vase"". This is totally the 1895 version of a TikTok video. It features Auguste Lumiere having fun with his baby, as they play with a vase full of goldfish.

The film's condition is in poor shape but that doesn't take away from the fun as the kangaroo seems to be getting a good work out at the very least.

tt0000049,"Boxing Match; or, Glove Contest",1896.0,4.8,56,"Short,Sport","This crude early film was shown at the Cinema Muto festival in Sacile, Italy, in October 2006. The very earliest film-makers (such as Birt Acres, who made this film) often used their cameras to record sporting events: this saved them the cost of hiring actors and staging scripts, and early nickelodeon customers would gladly pay to watch films of sporting events which they hadn't seen in person. Boxing matches were especially well-suited to the new medium, as these featured plenty of action but kept the combatants combined in a small area (the boxing ring) directly in front of the primitive movie camera, which (of necessity) was stationary.Birt Acres, the American-born film pioneer in Britain, is known to have filmed at least two boxing matches in 1895/96. The other one is apparently lost. This one was filmed at the military tournament (an athletic competition among the British armed forces) near Cardiff in August 1896. (IMDb give a release date of January '96, which I believe is an error.) Cardiff is one of my favourite cities, so I was keenly disappointed that this film offers no real nineteenth-century glimpse of that metropolis. However, we do see corner men, a referee and the ringside spectators in addition to the pugilists. One of the boxers is an army sergeant named Pope (no forename recorded), the other a sergeant-instructor (presumably of boxing) named F. Barratt. Damned if I know which is which. One boxer knocks down the other. Damned if I know which. The fight itself (we see about a round and a half) looks genuine enough ... until we come to a knockdown which looks suspiciously staged, as if Acres wanted to make sure that his audience got a good solid ending with a (literal) punch.As neither of these two combatants is important to the history of boxing, and as the rules of boxing in the 1890s are already well documented, this film's historical significance is minimal. But then, I'm not especially a fan of boxing. I tend to be fascinated by all movies that were made before 1900, but this one fascinates me a lot less than most from that period. Perhaps this brief film rates some significance as the very first fight scene in movie history. I'll rate it 4 out of 10.",United Kingdom,Birt Acres,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000049/,short,1896,

THE TURN-OF-THE-CENTURY BLIND MAN is a pretty simple and straight-forward prank film as a homeless man is pushed off a park bench by a police officer. The poor man then puts his outfit on a rich man sleeping in that same chair just to see the officer go after him. AT THE HYPNOTISTS has pretty much what you'd expect from a film with its title as a hypnotist makes a man do various funny things. THE BURGLARS takes place on a rather obvious but funny set as two crooks try to break into a house as a couple cops come after them. DISAPPEARING ACT is a poor man's Melies wannabe as a magician makes a woman turn into a devil then turns it back into a man. The final film, SURPRISE ATTACK ON A HOUSE AT DAYBREAK is without question the most impressive of this group as soldiers close in on another group of soldiers held up in a house. This short, running a brief 50-seconds, is without question the highlight here as we get a pretty good battle sequence that was years before the work of Griffith would come into play. Guy handles the material quite well and manages to make the film feel a lot bigger than it actually is. The other four films are all a mixed bag as the middle three come off as lesser copies of films we've seen from both Edison and Melies.

Not because of the full-blown irony from a watered-down remake would set a precedent for the future of cinema (thanks...). It's a mysterious film that is actually hypothetically lost. George Albert Smith is attached to this forty second short, which is a direct remake of Méliès' three minute 'Le Manoir Du Diable'. But, history tells us that it was actually Méliès who directed this a year after his original. Smith seemingly purchased the film for British audiences, to which they all presumed he directed it. And so his name was forever attached. Fascinating how time skews works of art!Anyway, the vital scenes of the skeleton appearing and transforming into a shadowy figure which then morphs into a ghost are still present. It just happens much much quicker. That's about it really. The editing is considerably more frantic, particularly the jump cuts, and the charm and creativity of the original is practically non-existent. The eccentric character movements are minimal and the magical horror elements are lacklustre to say the least. Oh, and either the end of the film is lost or Méliès/Smith couldn't be bothered to finish the film. It literally makes no sense to remake a film a year after the original, almost rendering this useless. An exercise in futility.

Perhaps the IMDb dating is a compromise of the two editions.In any case, when we compare this to the Lumiere's pictures of babies, particularly Lumiere's QUERELLE ENFANTINE (1895), we notice that 1: the composition and background are simpler -- face on shot, blank wall behind -- and that the children are much more natural, livelier, and humorous -- they wear big floppy hats.

tt0000172,The X-Ray Fiend,1897.0,6.0,1.1K,"Comedy,Horror,Short","This very early film by British auteur George Albert Smith is essentially a single 44 second 'joke': a courting couple are exposed to X-rays, but love prevails as their skeletons continue to cavort until the gentleman goes a titch to far, prompting his lady-friend, now restored to natural opaqueness, to get up and leave (after delivering a mild slap of indignation). The film is a whimsical bit of cinema history, playing on the public fascination with X-rays, which had only been discovered by Wilhelm Röntgen two years prior and showcasing Smith's 'state of the art' special effects (nicely executed jump cuts). The film is a product of its Victorian times as the 'leg bones' of the skeletonised women are demurely painted on her dress rather than on her *gasp* legs. Try to watch with the eyes of a 19th century viewer and imagine their astonishment as the lovebirds suddenly become skeletons.",United Kingdom,George Albert Smith,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000172/,short,1897,1
tt0000173,Battle of Santiago Bay,1900.0,4.6,47,"Short,War","The Yorkshire-born showman J. Stuart Blackton was an important figure in the early history of American movies. Most of his early films were newsreel-style records of actual current events ... but their historical value is compromised, because Blackton's films are often re-enactments (often blatantly faked) of these incidents, filmed days or weeks after they occurred.'Battle of Santiago Bay' purports to depict an actual incident in the Spanish-American War: a sea battle off the coast of Cuba. However, the entire film (made several weeks after the battle) is so blatantly faked that by modern standards it is downright laughable.Blackton and his cameraman partner Albert E. Smith obtained photographs of the ships which had participated in the battle, including the U.S.S. 'Iowa', the U.S.S. 'Illinois', and the Spanish fleet. They carefully cut out the ships from the photos' backgrounds, and glued these to small wooden blocks. In their tiny 10'x12' studio in a Brooklyn office building, they floated this bogus navy in a canvas water-tank and filmed the 'battle', while stagehands standing out of camera range blew cigarette smoke towards the camera. None of the 'ships' actually fire their guns; the crude models weren't sophisticated enough for this.Viewed today, 'Battle of Santiago Bay' is blatantly phony. Some of the ships are not parallel to the camera's focal plane, so it's obvious that they're two-dimensional cutouts. The smoke of the 'artillery fire' is moving towards the ships from out of frame, rather than emerging from the gundecks. The water in the 'bay' is slopping back and forth like water in a bucket, with no whitecaps or tidal patterns.Were audiences in 1898 actually fooled? Considering the extreme novelty of the new Vitascope invention, maybe they were. Even if they weren't, this film catered for their war-thirst and gave them an excuse to cheer the images on screen. An early precedent for much of what was to follow. I'll rate this early movie 4 out of 10. Ship ahoy!",United States,J. Stuart Blackton,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000173/,short,1900,

tt0000190,Dostavenícko ve mlýnici,1898.0,4.7,163,"Comedy,Short","It didn't take much time for cinema to develop its own genres. The proto-documentary actuality film and the prank-punitive comedy may be traced back to the first Lumière Cinématographe screening. From the latter, a sort of subgenre emerged of courtship comedies, with R. W. Paul and Alfred Moul's ""The Soldier's Courtship"" (1896) usually being credited as the first and which Paul remade the same year as this film as ""Tommy Atkins in the Park"" (1898). Perhaps, evidence of the genre's popularity in early cinema is best exemplified by its appearance in the films-within-the-film of ""The Countryman and the Cinematograph"" (1901), as well as its American rip-off ""Uncle Josh at the Moving Picture Show"" (1902). It's one of three types of films in those mise-en-abymes along with the popular subjects of dancing girls and approaching trains.The courtship comedy works along the same lines as the prank-punitive formula except it's more specific, as the prank is a man kissing an unfaithful woman and this being discovered by the husband, resulting in the punitive comedic violence of these pictures. Notable is how this formula relies on sight, that of the characters much as the film's effectiveness rests on that of the spectator. Another interesting thing about this particular courtship comedy made by Czechoslovakia's first filmmaker and exhibitor, Jan Krízenecký, is that it features what appears to be an advertisement for projected motion-picture exhibition, as the man and others carry out a sign in one shot before the film jump cuts to the courtship comedy. Although, the film was reportedly preserved from two separate prints, so the jump cut may instead only reflect missing footage in the middle from that splicing back together--I don't know. As it is, it's an unusual bit of editing for a non-trick, nor actuality, film from the period. Paul's ""Come Along Do!"" of the same year, for instance, is often credited as the first fiction film to feature two spatially distinct scenes. I suppose it's less remarkable for its time in its breaking-the-fourth wall direct address to the spectator in advertising cinema, as early cinema is all about this sort of ""cinema of attractions"" over the later narrative film.Further demonstrating how solidified genres already were in early cinema, the other two 1898 relative fiction films from Krízenecký included on the Czech National Film Archive home video were also popular film subjects at the time. One is more of a broad punitive-prank film also involving the same advertisement, but which is incorporated into its embryonic plot, as opposed to standing outside of it as here. The other film is a facial-expression comedy where an actor is filmed in close-up making faces.See my review for ""Svatojanská pout' ceskoslovanské vesnici"" (""Midsummer Pilgrimage in a Czechoslavic Village"") regarding Krízenecký's early actuality films.",Czechoslovakia,Jan Krízenecký,Josef Sváb-Malostranský,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000190/,short,1898,1

Bitzer and Marvin would later attain screen immortality for their work with D.W.

The box was found to contain 32 films, including hand-colored prints of The Devil in a Convent, and another 1899 Méliès film, The Mysterious Knight. Previously, these two films had only been available in black-and-white copies. The hand-colored print of The Devil in a Convent was judged to be in too advanced a state of decomposition to be restored completely, however, the third scene of the film was in good enough condition to be restored. Both films were entrusted to the Filmoteca de Catalunya for restoration, under the supervision of two Méliès scholars, Roland Cosandey and Jacques Malthête.

tt0000256,Panorama from the Tower of the Brooklyn Bridge,1899.0,4.8,189,"Documentary,Short","It is quite false to believe that there is no camera movement in early films or that decisions to use or not use certain effects were a result or technical backwardness. It is true that close-ups remain relatively rare and that panning in or away from the subject was almost unknown before the 1910s. But it was not have been in the least bit difficult to achieve the former nor would it have been difficult to achieve the latter (by mounting the camera on a dolly) but film-makers were probably worried that such movements would simply be distracting and irritating for the audiences (as in many poor modern films they can be). There are of course several well-known instances of close-ups in films of the 1900s but film-makers long remained chary of their use and in many ways were wise to be so. Overuse of the close-up is again one of worst failings of many modern films. As for panning, there are earlier examples(in the very earliest films of Yevgeny Bauer, for instance) but the ground-breaking Italian epic Cabiria (1914) was principally responsible for popularising what for many years afterwards was known in the US as ""a Cabiria shot"" (both the pan-in and the pan-out). But panning continued to be used with great moderation and that, as with the close-up, was a matter of choice not of technical incapacity.Lateral movement of the camera was, on the other hand, not so uncommon. Travelling shots had been in use in the US (principally for ""ghost rides"" but occasionally for panoramas) since the summer of 1896 and panoramas had had been regular fare everywhere since the autumn and winter of 1896, when they became virtually a trademark of Lumière cinematographers wherever they went. By this time already become something of a cliché. Circular(360 degree)panoramas were also easy enough to achieve but they only came into fashion at the time of the Paris Exposition of 1900 where not only the Lumières but nearly all film-companies made extensive use of them. If this film really were shot in April 1899 it would be an early example but why then should the film not be copyrighted until September 1903. It is far more likely that the date is an error and that it was in fact shot in April 1903, when circular panoramas had become commonplace. Expositions in the US in 1901-2(Pan-American, Charleston) had already provided plenty of excuses for them.",United States,,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000256/,short,1899,1

tt0000265,Above the Limit,1900.0,4.4,165,"Comedy,Short","I noticed that another reviewer scored this one a 10. Well, I choose not to rate it at all. That's because the film is only about 50 seconds long and there just isn't enough to rate--which is true of most films from the 1890s and very, very early 1900s. Most films during this time were about a minute or two and only give you a small glimpse into the time.In this case, Charlie Grapewin does a silent monologue as the character Chimmie Hicks. Interestingly, the stage is bare and black and Grapewin acts as if he's at the race track--and he is quite convincing in such a minimalist setting. The only other performer is his bookie who is only briefly in the film. Through the course of the quick film, you see Chimmie at the heights of excitement and depths of despair--depending on how his horse is doing in a particular race. The acting is pretty exciting to watch and this is a nice historical clip to remember Grapewin's vaudeville act (he later was a supporting actor in films).",United States,,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000265/,short,1900,

tt0000272,As Seen Through a Telescope,1900.0,5.6,955,"Comedy,Short","This comic short has a similar plot to Smith's previous 'Grandma's Reading Glass' - a male protagonist looks at the world through the eyes of an optical instrument.  Where the visions of the first film, however, were appropriate to a young boy - curious, novel, fresh, surprising ways of looking at the world as if for the first time (e.g. like the first cinema goers), the development of an individual consciousness as it were - the point of view in this film is typical of an aged lecher, as he gawps at the incipient sexual tease performed by a man and a bicycled woman as he ties up her shoelace, slowly raising her long dress to reveal a titillating glimpse of stockinged leg.The move here from the encyclopaedic to the sexual and voyeuristic may be symptomatic of the 'wrong' turning taken by cinema, bemoaned by the likes of Godard, away from a curious interest in the world to vulgar, voyeuristic, prurient peepshows.  But Smith is no fool, and the clatter the scopophile receives from one of his 'victims' is given to us too - we are no better than this pervert.The set-up cries out for voyeurism - a distanced shot of an environment offers us a brief glimpse of the couple in the background - the only way we can learn more is with the aid of this man's instrument, significantly more phallic that Grandma's female lens.  There is no distortion here, as was the case with the first film, but clarification, a feeling of being close to the action, but apart from it: enjoyment without risk, the dream of every voyeur.In a sense, this simple plot - voyeur attacked by the man he spies on - foreshadows one of the great masterpieces of cinema and the ultimate analysis of cinematic voyeurism and the invasion of privacy, 'Rear Window'. The man's instrument may be phallic, but it is onanistic and sterile, especially in comparison to the fertile sexual relations presumably to be enjoyed at a later date by the couple.  The cinematic gaze is already being made negative, anti-social, hidden, something to be punished, something unhealthy, anti-family, solitary.  The watcher must be watched, controlled, as the victim's punitive action suggests.But it's not that simple.  The framing circle of the close-up is linked to the circles of the wheels and pedals of the bicycle, maybe even the circle of life that this courtship intimates, just as Jeff's voyeurism is framed against his reluctance to settle down with his girlfriend.

Second, the film has pretty poor trick cinematography--Méliès had been doing similar but much more spectacular trick work on film and he was the master as making things appear and disappear on film.

tt0000337,Spanish Bullfight,1900.0,4.9,392,"Short,Sport","I watched this film on a DVD that was rammed with short films from the period. I didn't watch all of them as the main problem with these type of things that their value is more in their historical novelty value rather than entertainment. So to watch them you do need to be put in the correct context so that you can keep this in mind and not watch it with modern eyes. With the Primitives & Pioneers DVD collection though you get nothing to help you out, literally the films are played one after the other (the main menu option is ""play all"") for several hours. With this it is hard to understand their relevance and as an educational tool it falls down as it leaves the viewer to fend for themselves, which I'm sure is fine for some viewers but certainly not the majority. What it means is that the DVD saves you searching the web for the films individually by putting them all in one place  but that's about it.Like many viewers of this film when it came out, I have not actually seen a bull fight for myself and as such the ""event"" captured here offers interest if not moral neutrality. The capturing of the action is very clear and well framed to keep the bull in shot without moving the camera. Frustratingly as is often the case it feels like we are seeing a snippet of something rather than the ""something"" in its entirety but this is probably for the best. I'm sure some will dislike this for what it captures but at least nothing too brutal is shown here and indeed a lot of it is dull! Overall though, it is nice to see a static event captured that is more than a train pulling into a station, even if some modern viewers will not appreciate the actions being captured here.",France,,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000337/,short,1900,1

Basically a man walks into a room where he goes to undress for bed but he's haunted by an invisible force. There's obviously nothing ground-breaking here but for the most part this is entertaining enough to where it's worth watching for fans of these early movies.

His celebrity, which still survives to this day, isn't based on his being a buffalo hunter in the 1860s. There were many of those, and Cody is about the only one we know of. His continued celebrity rests on his having been a canny showman and publicist, portrayed in Dime Novels, Wild West Shows bearing his name, movies like this and ANNIE OAKLEY, Broadway shows like ANNIE GET YOUR GUN, television (go check the IMDb listing for ""Buffalo Bill Cody"" and you'll find over fifty listings for the character), a screen actor who went under the name of ""Buffalo Bill Jr.""...You name it, it's there. Because there is a persistence of celebrity, just like there is a persistence of momentum. Sometimes celebrity continues, even when the reasons for it have vanished. There seem to be people famous just for being famous. You hear someone say ""Look! It's Buffalo Bill Cody!"" and point and that's how you know him. Later, you point and say it too.Anyway, this is one from a paper print at the Library of Congress. It's impossible to make out any details.

tt0000363,The Magic Sword,1901.0,6.2,219,"Fantasy,Romance,Short","I viewed the British Film Institute print of this early movie by Robert W Paul. Like his better-known contemporary Georges Melies in France, Britain's Paul was an early film-maker who experimented with the camera's possibilities to produce 'trick' films. While these very early movies must have baffled and delighted their audiences, I tend to dislike 'trick' films because what we're seeing is not any sort of stagecraft nor prestidigitation by a skilled conjuror: it's basically just jump cuts, the same device still being used sixty years onward to enable Samantha off 'Bewitched' to appear and disappear. While Paul and Melies deserve credit for innovation, from our modern jaded viewpoint the device has long since palled. (No pun intended on 'Paul'.)'The Magic Sword', unlike so many Paul films but like quite a few of Melies's more ambitious productions, is lifted out of the genre of 'trick' films -- and is much more entertaining -- because it uses its camera effects in the service of telling an actual story, rather than merely showing objects appearing and vanishing. The IMDb synopsis of this film is accurate enough. Basically, this movie tells us the story of a 'mediaeval' knight and his fair lady. When the damsel is nobbled by hobgoblins, the knight must use a magical sword to help him rescue her. All of the supernatural events which we witness in this film are in the service of the story, rather than merely for the sake of ""Hey presto!"".I'm impressed that these very early film-makers realised that the story is more important than the special effects. I can think of a few modern film-makers who need to learn that lesson.The 'mediaeval' settings and costumes in 'The Magic Sword' are not remotely convincing, and not for one instant do we forget that these are actors performing on a proscenium stage. However, the story's a fantasy, so it doesn't need to be convincing. 'The Magic Sword' is a very charming film, which even modern audiences (jaded by CGI F/X) can appreciate. My rating: a full 10 out of 10.",United Kingdom,Walter R. Booth,Walter R. Booth,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000363/,short,1901,2

This one here offered a look at the exposition at night, which might sound simple today but if you go through these early movies you'll come to realize that very few were actually filmed at night. The effect obviously works here because you've got these amazing looking lights that the camera could easily pick up. I can only imagine that these night films made a lot more money than the regular ones because people in 1901 just weren't used to seeing stuff at night. The cinematography was extremely good for the period and there's no question that the film perfectly captures the lights and images.",United States,Edwin S.

At a time when cinema was still in its infancy and the camera enjoyed less movement than the audience that watched its output, British pioneer R. W. Paul fashions a highly comical short that uses the limitations of the new technology to his advantage. The premise is simple. Two men playing chess argue over whether one of the men has cheated by covertly moving one of his pieces and the argument quickly escalates into blows. As the camera remains static, however, we don't see any of the action once the men are fighting on the floor other than the occasional flailing fist or piece of dislodged clothing being hurled into the air.

tt0000436,An Extraordinary Cab Accident,1903.0,6.1,572,"Comedy,Short","I watched this film on a DVD that was rammed with short films from the period. I didn't watch all of them as the main problem with these type of things that their value is more in their historical novelty value rather than entertainment. So to watch them you do need to be put in the correct context so that you can keep this in mind and not watch it with modern eyes. With the Primitives & Pioneers DVD collection though you get nothing to help you out, literally the films are played one after the other (the main menu option is ""play all"") for several hours. With this it is hard to understand their relevance and as an educational tool it falls down as it leaves the viewer to fend for themselves, which I'm sure is fine for some viewers but certainly not the majority. What it means is that the DVD saves you searching the web for the films individually by putting them all in one place  but that's about it.Robert Paul continues to develop the media within Britain here with this action film that uses stop-motion animation of a sort. To modern viewers this film will not be anything new or impressive but imagine it 100 years ago and remember that this is a time only a few years after scenes of trains moving on the screen caused panic! Technology always looks dated and so it is with this film, but that does not take away from its importance or its impact at the time. Heck, look at Jurassic Park  looks dated even 10 years later as the media moves past it but that doesn't mean it isn't a good film or important at the time.So it is here as the film has horrific convincing action and a ""death"" that must have had the audience on the edge of its seat only to provide the relief in a comic aside right at the end.

I've seen a few of these old firemen movies, but haven't yet seen any footage of them actually battling a fire. If you watch this film closely you'll see that one of their vehicles actually has street urchins hanging off the back. The camera, operated by one B. Bitzer, is static and the angle is all wrong because the engines aren't on screen long enough before they have whizzed past.

By 1903 movies had lost their novelty value and were played at the end of vaudeville shows as 'chasers', a device for chasing the last few members of the audience out of the auditorium after the main show had finished. Watching this film we can only imagine that, as a chaser it would be frighteningly effective. Of course, we're watching it from the opposite end of a spectrum so the sense of wonder at the moving image is long past, but so it was in 1903 and it's difficult to see anyone thinking this was a worthwhile subject for a film at any time.",United States,,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000459/,short,1903,2

tt0000497,A Railway Tragedy,1904.0,5.2,97,"Crime,Short","The most noticeable thing about this short drama is the way that it resourcefully builds up the suspense and the anticipation of danger in the earlier sequences. The technical side in itself is pretty straightforward, but the scenario is well-conceived, and for the most part the performers carry it off pretty well.The basic story, with a woman in danger from a strange man on a train, is quite similar to the stories in many other features in the first decade of the 20th century. But this is better from most, due to the way that the movie patiently sets things up in a way that creates suspense, rather than jumping right into tumultuous action.The early scenes show the woman going about her own affairs, unaware that the man is watching her all the while. The camera shots are composed carefully enough so that you can pick up what is happening if you watch closely, and it allows the audience to sense the danger before the character does - a technique that is now thoroughly familiar in crime and horror movies, but it shows some resourcefulness for a film-maker to have done this deliberately and carefully in 1904.Most of the rest is straightforward - a couple of times there is a slight shifting of the camera to take in more of the action, but otherwise there are few surprises in the events or in the technique - but the effective use of technique in its earlier scenes is enough to make it stand out for its time.",United Kingdom,,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000497/,short,1904,5

In this case, it's about a farmer who puts up a notice he is looking for a wife, and is soon fleeing from a dozen women. It is worth noting that Edison released 'How a French Nobleman Got a Wife Through the 'New York Herald' Personal Columns' in September of 1904 and this film was first screened in December of 1904. Perhaps de Chomon saw Porter's film and transferred the venue to Spain or perhaps they both derive from a common antecedent.In any case, this is a decent enough film for the period, with several camera placements -- all of which are unmoving -- and a decent pay off shot.

Porter isn't a complete success but it is rather interesting and worth viewing if you're a fan of silent cinema. The DVD features a brief ""warning"" about the movie not making sense and they actually give a full synapses as to what is suppose to be going on. In the 17-minute running time we see a wide range of events taking place in a Western town. We see cowboys doing various tricks with ropes and their horses and we even see a fight break out. There's a stagecoach robbery as well as an action packed ending where a woman is kidnapped. None of these events really blend well together as it seems images and stories just pop up out of no where and there doesn't seem to have been any attempt to make a good flowing story. The DVD also mentions that the theater showing this picture would have added narration trying to explain what was going on. Many consider THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY to be the first Western ever made but many historians look at it as a crime picture and they consider this to be the first Western. There are certainly many familiar scenes that would become the norm for a Western but in the end nothing really adds up to make this a good movie.

tt0000571,The San Francisco Earthquake,1906.0,6.7,74,"Documentary,History,Short","Unlike Biograph's laughably bad fake film San Francisco Disaster, in which the makers set fire to a cardboard model of the city and tried to pass it off as the real thing, J. Stuart Blackton's film goes out on the streets of the earthquake-ravaged city of San Francisco to capture scenes of the real carnage wrought by the quake.As you'd expect, the film shows plenty of dusty rubble and gutted buildings, but it also dwells briefly on a more personal moment as the camera watches a group of men queueing for handouts at a food (or water) stand. The sight of people going about their daily business, and of tram cars passing the camera as it focuses on ruined buildings and fallen statues provides a striking contrast but, given the fact that this film was made while cinema was still in its infancy, the lack of in-depth detail is a little frustrating.",United States,J.

The copy is 11 minutes long but none the less makes a coherent narrative. The camera is static and uses long takes although close-ups are inserted. At times the camera is positioned on a diagonal to avoid the right-angle look, and it there are some slight pans. It is filmed on four outside locations and in one interior (a painted set). It is an early example of the rural melodramas that were going to be popular in Spain, with situations that Bunuel will enjoy subverting. The outside locations have probably not been modified and therefore present an interesting reflection of the rural Spain around Valencia.

I could not detect the seams.Also, quite clearly, de Chomon could outspend Melies, with more chorines, more costume changes and color stenciling for the prints that Melies could not begin to match.Yet these pieces, intended to take away Melies market, as good as they are, lack something that makes Melies great even today: the joy of performance. Melies showed you magic and enjoyed it as a performer. This piece, as well as it starts, just seems to go on and on, like someone who won't let you hang up a telephone, but always has one more thing to say. By the fourth costume change -- into characters that might have climbed down from Angkor Wat -- and the fifth set of transformations -- oh, clearly that's just a curtain with a hole in it -- my attention was beginning to wander.

As in most of the better of these early features, it gets pretty much all that it could have out of the premise, and then it stops rather than dragging things out to an anticlimax. An economically filmed feature like this contrasts well with some of the more recent movies that try to squeeze 90-120 minutes worth of screen time out of 10 minutes worth of ideas.The story starts with an old idea, as a husband and wife both attend the same costume party without recognizing each other. From there, it leads on to some generally humorous situations. Most of it is entertaining, and it is filmed economically without any dead time or pointless action. The actress playing the wife probably does the best with some of her expressions in response to the situation.

tt0000641,Balked at the Altar,1908.0,4.7,193,"Comedy,Short","While not all that funny, this short comedy is just amusing enough at times to be watchable. As one of Griffith's very early efforts, the technique is not very refined, and the slapstick tone also makes it quite a bit different from any of his more well-known pictures.Most of the story is an extended humorous look at a romantic spinster whose eagerness to get married is evident to all. The first part is not very sensitive towards any of the characters, and it is not very entertaining, but it begins to pick up later on. For a short while, the action gets enjoyably manic, and the finale has a decent gag.Griffith never really developed that good of a sense of humor, and his occasional attempts at comic relief in his longer features usually did not work all that well. But this picture is nearly as good, as a comedy, as his earliest dramas were as serious cinema, so perhaps if he had concentrated more on humor, it's possible that he could have made better or more worthwhile comedies later on.In any event, this one is insubstantial, but it has just enough to be of some interest for those of us who enjoy watching these very old movies for their own sake.",United States,D.W.

After all, to what can you compare it?! Emile Cohl made this film. It is a very simple sort of animation--done in a less than simple manner. It consists of white childish drawings on a black background. But then it gets odd, the drawing CONSTANTLY morphs and changes in a strange stream of consciousness. While it's not something I'd want to watch for a long period of time, it is short as well as an interesting experiment. Worth seeing if you are an art student or an insane fan of animation (like me).

tt0000684,Father Gets in the Game,1908.0,5.0,141,"Comedy,Short","A previous IMDb reviewer has stated that Jeanie Macpherson, who appears in this film, was Cecil B. DeMille's wife. That's not correct. Macpherson had a long and significant career as DeMille's favourite scenarist; she wrote or co-wrote the scripts for many of DeMille's most important films and quite a few of his obscure films. Macpherson (who appears in this movie as a young flirt) was quite attractive in her younger days, and there are rumours that she and DeMille had a long sexual relationship. But she was definitely never married to him.'Father Gets in the Game' features Mack Sennett -- the future king of Keystone -- in unconvincing makeup and whitened hair as Wilkins, an ageing man who watches enviously as his adult son courts the pretty young ladies. Wilkins goes to a hairdresser for a dye job: the hairdresser is named Dyem, which tells you what sort of comedy this is. Conveniently youthened (and looking much more like Sennett's actual appearance at this time), Wilkins goes forth with lecherous intentions. He flirts with various young ladies (including Macpherson and Linda Arvidson), some of them more friendly than others. Slapstick complications ensue, with a few proto-Keystone pratfalls.The most interesting aspect of this early comedy is the inclusion of some exterior sequences shot in Central Park, with some genuine pedestrians caught by the camera. I'll rate 'Father Gets in the Game' 5 out of 10, mostly for its historical significance.",United States,D.W. Griffith,D.W. Griffith,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000684/,short,1908,10

You don't feel any concern for the characters whatsoever, primarily on the basis of the fact that they are an extension of his own personality rather than discovering their soul through performance. The actors certainly don't have a voice in this piece, and I felt cheated that there wasn't a story to tell. The camera tends to be too passive in its observations of events.

I don't particularly like this offering in the same that I didn't like 'Robinson Crusoe', but I did feel that I could do it better in the same way that I felt that I could rewrite 'Crusoe' in an improved way. What this film needed was a trans-valuation of viewpoint so that it could be digested more easily for contemporary audiences. As it stands, it is unpalatable, not because of the period or the subject matter, but just the point of view.

tt0000843,The Death Disc: A Story of the Cromwellian Period,1909.0,6.1,42,"Drama,Short","Mark Twain's ""Death Disk"" was inspired by the historical account of the execution of Col. John Poyer of Pembroke, Wales on 21 April 1649. A small child was given the responsibility of choosing which of three rebel leaders of a civil uprising would receive a death penalty. The fate was given to Poyer who was shot in front of a large crowd at Covent Garden. In 1883, Twain read about the child's role in the execution in a copy of Carlyle's Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell, (Wiley & Putnam, 1845, pp. 344-345). In his personal notebook, Twain's imagination led him to remark, ""By dramatic accident it could have been his own child"" (Notebook #22, reprinted in Mark Twain's Notebooks & Journals, Volume III, 1883-1891, p. 14). In December 1883, Twain wrote his friend William Dean Howells, ""Now let's write a tragedy"" (Mark Twain-Howells Letters, Volume II, p. 455). In his letter to Howells, he included the manuscript of the closing scene where a young girl unknowingly gives her own father a death sentence. Twain's original version ended in the father's execution.
 Twain's plan to complete the tragedy went nowhere for over a decade. In December 1899 he wrote from London to Katharine Harrison that he had recently completed ""The Death Disk."" Twain had revised the story and it now included a miraculous ending well-suited for the Christmas season. It was published in the 1901 Christmas issue of Harper's Magazine. On 8 February 1902, the story was staged as a one-act play at the Children's Theatre at Carnegie Hall. According to an announcement in The New York Times, 7 February 1902, child actress Beatrice Abbey (stage name of Mrs. Ethel Foster Hollearn) would star in the lead role in the play titled ""Little Lady and Lord Cromwell.""
 Twain had struggled with writing the story. He attempted no less than 6 drafts of the story before accepting the advice of British publisher Robert McClure to simply write it as he'd told the tale in person.",United States,D.W.

One day, Mr. Kirkwood goes out on a hunting jaunt, in a canoe; when he rises to fire at some game, the canoe capsizes. Apparently a poor swimmer, Kirkwood is rescued by nearby hunter Frank Powell (as Ed). Mr. Powell helps dry Kirkwood off, and the two crawl under a blanket for the evening. The next morning, Kirkwood thanks Powell for his kindness, and goes on his way. Then, Ms. Leonard meets Powell, while on one of her shopping trips; and, they kindle an attraction. Soon, Leonard and Powell are meeting regularly, and decide to run away together, leaving Kirkwood in the cold Remarkable 1909 story, content-wise, from D.W. Griffith, G.W. Bitzer, and the good folks at Biograph. Leonard's performance as a ""torn-between-two-loves"" woman is a highlight, ahead of its time. Her leading men do are quite good, also, with some implausible situations.

Not even in its high art films, in which the Vitagraph Company displays its talent for elaborate staging, has it ever produced a subject which so gripped the attention of moving picture theatre-goers. As we watched the effect that this film produced on a crowded house, we could not help feeling that the silent drama had come into its own as a substantial and permanent means of entertainment. It has been interpreted by capable actors whose faces are new in Vitagraph films. Without exception their parts were well performed, and the scenes are so well arranged and so convincing that the film, as a whole, stands out as being so far above the average that the Vitagraph folks will have to work hard to excel it or even to keep up to its standard. - The Moving Picture World, June 26, 1909",United States,Van Dyke Brooke,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000872/,short,1909,

tt0000880,The Girls and Daddy,1909.0,5.7,93,"Drama,Short","This is not necessarily a bad short feature, but its interest as a movie is rather less than its value as a historical record. That's because it survives as two distinct prints, one of which is the finished movie, and the other of which preserves the scenes in the order that they were filmed, allowing the viewer to, in a sense, see D.W. Griffith at work.The movie itself is about average, though it has some obvious flaws. Most of the individual sequences are filmed well enough, but the story as a whole does not always flow, since it leaves some of the details obscured. You can still follow the important steps in the action, though. The story is mildly interesting, with some moments of tension, but at the cost of lessened credibility, in that there are too many coincidences for them not to become noticeable.The alternate print is interesting because it shows Griffith's strategy of filming, including his concern with things such as settings and details, camera angles, and the like. Griffith often gets more credit for innovation than is probably actually due him, since other film-makers came up with some of the same or similar ideas as he did, but instances like this show how systematic Griffith was, and in that respect he may well have stood out among the directors of the time.",United States,D.W.

There is plenty of stiletto work, some shooting and a dogged persistence in trailing which would do credit to a Sherlock Holmes. The story is a simple one of love and jealousy, with the peculiar characteristics of the people represented carefully worked out. As one watches the pictures, noting the work of the separate actors, it seems like one of the most consistent films the Biograph Company has ever put out. Costuming and surroundings are faithfully reproduced, with details introduced which add materially to its attractiveness. It is an example of making a somewhat repulsive subject interesting, and, as such, reflects credit on the producers; but judging from the comments we have heard, the subject itself and the graphic portrayal is a bit too repellent for select audiences. In most Biograph pictures there is a good moral or an episode of real life that is made interesting and instructive, but we cannot see any reason for portraying such sentiments as are expressed ""In Little Italy."" - The Moving Picture World, January 8, 1910",United States,D.W.

Metropolitan audiences show great appreciation of pictures of this character. week. The skillful horsemanship of the rough riders seems to be a welcome variation from the silly chases at 11 cents per, and in this film of ""The Indian Trailer"" the scenery and action is of the best. There are a few slips in the production that were overlooked or unnoticed by a critical audience. The route of the dog which carries the message to the bereaved father and the apparent readiness of the man who takes the message are points which rather weaken an otherwise thrilling production, but, on the whole, it is a film that is far above the average, and, as we said before, its power to interest the average audience was strikingly manifested. - The Moving Picture World, May 22, 1909",United States,Gilbert M.

tt0000954,Mamma,1909.0,,,Short,"The 34 year old D.W. Griffith may know how to paint a moving image picture, but he knows nothing about character development and plotting. The formula that he uses in this film is antiquated and does not make entertaining viewing. There is no diversity in this piece whatsoever, and the story that he has to tell lacks crispiness. This offering suffers from its absence of colour. The fresh air is stifled through the narrative, the selection of characters and the heavy emphasis on technical experimentation.

tt0000957,Mariage forcé,1914.0,6.2,53,"Comedy,Short","It is always a pleasure-and one that both aristocrats and commoners can share- to watch any of Herr Max Linder's short silent comedies, films so brief you don't have to leave your post or interrupt your duties ( not a problem for aristocrats who, of course have no duties ).And certainly it is a joy watching Herr Max Linder handling many problems in ""Le Marriage Forcé"" (1913), after being told by his uncle he must marry or face having his income cut off. Unfortunately, the frauleins suggested by Herr Max's uncle reject him so, in order not to lose his allowance, Max disguises one of his male servants in feminine garb and announces he has found his beloved ( servants can sometimes be very dutiful ). However, complications arise when Herr Max's uncle promises him an extra 200,000 francs when his bride gives birth to their first child, a heavy task for even a faithful servant to accomplish.""Le Marriage Forcé"" spoofs the French bourgeoisie of the early 10s, especially during the wedding scene wherein the guests arrive at the city hall in elegant and fashionable barouches, carriages that will be involved later in a peculiar fast motion chase around the city ( more elegant, certainly, than the usual American car city chases of the same era ). Of course, Herr Max's uncle uncovers his scheme and Max flees, pursued by the wedding guests but he finally overcomes them with the help of a hose, an efficient and hilarious comic resource as Herr Louis Lumière knew pretty well in those early silent days.""Le Marriage Forcé"" is an excellent Herr Linder short comedy that after almost 100 years later still retains its merits and is a showcase for the mastery of Herr Linder whose work has stood the test of time.And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must flee from a Teutonic heiress' marriage proposal.Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com",France,Max Linder,Molière,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000957/,short,1914,20

tt0001029,The Salvation Army Lass,1909.0,5.1,61,"Drama,Short","If you take a look at the version of this movie that has been posted to Youtube, you are not, I think, getting anything like the original theatrical version. Most obviously, the way the film moves -- derived from Library of Congress Paper prints -- is jerky. This is common to most of the older paper-print-derived Griffiths. Comparing versions of THE CURTAIN POLE from the 1970s with ones from the 2000s also shows a jerky movement that recent restorations lack. In addition, the long titles, including one or two that directly address Florence Lawrence's character, are nothing at all like any other Griffith movie I have ever seen. The conclusion that seems obvious to me is that this was restored by the Salvation Army for its own, didactic purposes, by people who seem to have no familiarity with the rapidly-evolving state of the art in the era in which it was made. The brass-band arrangement seems poor to me, but that is a matter of taste.Trying to make sense of it in terms of Griffith in 1909, I noticed his increasing command of crowd scenes, both in the tavern and on the street, where Miss Lawrence first encounters the Salvation Army; everyone is doing something that makes sense, and the flow of movement helps direct the eye. In addition, a later shot, in which people approach the camera, shows a moving composition that Griffith had first tried in 1908 and which would reach its peak in THE MUSKETEERS OF PIG ALLEY.Other than those bits, it's impossible to say much about this movie.",United States,D.W.

Five years later, Mr. West is a rich man. When hard times hit the old folks at home, Ms. Pickford writes West, suggesting a visit. To surprise his parents, West decides to conceal his identity. He puts on a hat, which compliments his already grown beard and moustache. When he returns, his parents don't recognize their son; ironically, they decide to rob the wealthy young stranger while he sleeps...West conceals his identity by putting on a hat? Perhaps director D.W. Griffith assumed viewers knew the parents' eyesight was failing? Father Prior seems in good enough health, to effortlessly lift a supposedly dead body, and carry it outside.

It is historically correct and involves a young soldier who was sentenced to be shot for sleeping on post, but who was pardoned by Lincoln and afterward was shot as he led the scattered Union soldiers to victory by rallying them around the colors. Perhaps the most interesting features of this film consist of the visions: first the one that appears to the President as he sees the soldiers, then the gray-haired mother and the nameless grave. At the end where the stars and stripes and stars and bars are rolled together and unrolled as the national flag, there is a touch of patriotic sentiment which is difficult to appreciate without seeing it. After all, the whole story of the Civil War is told in that little bit. While it is by no means certain that the producer intended to make that the climax of the picture, it is, and everyone who sees it is constrained to cheer. - The Moving Picture World, November 19, 1910",United States,Theodore Wharton,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001101/,movie,1910,

The daughter of the woman who keeps the house is played by Florence Lawrence; she is the angel, a harum-scarum creature with a woman's heart under her queer costume. She likes very much the shiftless garret artist, played by Owen Moore, and does her best, very successfully, to make things easy for him only to see him fall in love with a swan-like model. The ""angel"" is one of those parts that Miss Lawrence has created and its value comes from the subtle way that she makes the womanly feelings of the character shine through the awkward exterior of the goosie. It made a good offering, one that will stir sympathies and make laughter. - The Moving Picture World, November 2, 1912",United States,Harry Solter,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001114/,short,1912,

It has all the spirit and go which is so characteristic of the Essanay work, and at the same time it depicts life in the West so graphically and with so much appreciation of its essentials that one cannot fail to acquire a more accurate impression than ever before of the characteristics of that life. The Essanay players undertook their work sympathetically and they brought to its consummation a thorough knowledge of the requirements. The result is a notable picture, and one which will unquestionably be popular everywhere. It is a thousand pities that a picture of this character, suitable for continuous exhibition for several days, or possibly a week, should be subjected to the action of the daily change rule. It deserves more consideration than that. Managers should not hesitate to allow their patrons to see more of such films.

It is a transfer of Christmas to the plains and a reproduction of the novel taken to make it merry. Of course, much of the time-honored paraphernalia is necessary, but it is a new way to work it out. The film is scarcely dramatic, but it tells a good story in a plain, easily understood way. and presents the novelty of Christmas in the West.

Two really diabolical schemes are hatched, and one succeeds. Because it does succeed a woman dies at the hands of her lover after she has arranged to betray her husband. Even though this picture has qualities winch stamp it as unusually good, one rises after seeing it with a feeling that it would have been better if one had not seen it. Undoubtedly such instances are common. Indeed, it may safely be assumed that they are too common, yet after all one does not like to face the unpleasant fact and see such a disagreeable scene worked out before one's eyes. Perhaps this feeling is a tribute, unconsciously paid to the picture. If it were not good, if it were not made real, it would scarcely cause such an impression.

The action of the eldest daughter when she sees the hand protrude from the partially opened trunk is natural, and her coolness in devising a plan for summoning the police is commendable. There is some suspense, however, while the police are on the way, but the girls are not harmed and the officers arrive in time to capture all three of the robbers. The father returning at this time helps in the capture of the thieves.

Who would imagine that a film bearing such an innocent title would contain all the glamour of the wildest west, with bloodthirsty redskin bucks, dusky squaws, war dances, murder and pillage? It is all there to thrill the gallery gods; but, unusual thing, through it all runs a thread of human sympathy, delineated by the cleverest of child actresses and appealing to the sentiments of the most intelligent audience. The story is strong in its simplicity and has been handled with great dramatic power. It tells of a frontier settlement that was saved from annihilation by the gift of a doll which won the affection of an Indian child. Resenting the ill-treatment she received from the members of the tribe, the Indian child warns her friends in time of a hostile attack. She is mortally wounded by a stray shot during the conflict and as she lies down to die beside the grave she had prepared for the doll which had been destroyed by a cruel Indian, one cannot restrain a feeling of exultation that she has passed beyond the cruel life she was compelled to lead. All through the piece the acting is convincing and the realism of some of the scenes is impressive. It is a film which will please any audience. - The Moving Picture World, October 29, 1910",United States,D.W. Griffith,Belle Taylor,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001135/,short,1910,17

He brings them safely to town where they can obtain medicines, but in doing so subjects himself to arrest. However, when the sheriff understands what the desperado has done he permits him to go free on his promise that he will mend his ways. With no killing, without even a suspicion of a love story, this film is strangely interesting. There is a whole lot of humanity represented in it, and one feels something of the inspiration of an optimism which inculcates the belief that there is some good in everyone, provided that the means for discovering it can be found. Perhaps nothing makes such a strong appeal as weakness, and sometimes, as is so graphically shown in this film, much good is accomplished even by those who are weak and apparently helpless. - The Moving Picture World, August 13, 1910",United States,Gilbert M.

Consequently, various disturbances are interlarded to add to the interest and keep the interest of the reader, or hold the attention of the audience which is watching a picture. In this instance the poor little flower girl who innocently causes the misunderstanding that almost separates the lovers excites one's pity. She is the pathetic figure in this story, and unquestionably the sympathy of the audience will flow to her. That the lovers make up their differences does not seem strange. Lovers have a way of doing that. That they will live happily ever afterward is equally apparent, and this affords a satisfactory ending to a drama which included something of storm and stress.

There is almost a dangerous clash when the duped husband learns the true state of affairs, but he isn't quite quick enough and can't do what he would like.

All the dash and spirit of the ranch are in it, albeit the story is a bit trite. When the complications are all made straight and the little Western girl takes back her sweetheart, one feels relieved and is disposed to think how important a happy ending to a story of this sort is.

But this triumph is short, since he is forced to his knees and there made to confess that he did the shooting.

Later, when Bud Folsom confesses to a crime he didn't commit to save her from the gallows, the audience thrills with the intensity of its suppressed feelings. But the most dramatic scene of all comes when the white mistress of the cowboy half-breed, who actually committed the crime, denounces him in court at the peril of her own life. Then when Bud is set free and he and Ellen embrace, there is no question of the result. There is a bigness to this film which is impressive, but can scarcely be described. It seems to embody the wide sweep of the landscape and to depict the freedom of the great country in which the scenes are laid.

It tells of the love of a newspaper artist for a dancing girl, and exhibits a strongly dramatic picture when he discovers the truth regarding her occupation; but she convinces him of her purity and sincerity and they are married. Visible evidence is afforded afterward that in this instance, at least, the marriage was happy. While it is not a great film, it is well acted and the photography is clear and the situations are satisfactorily worked out. The film ends happily, which is an important point in pleasing the public. - The Moving Picture World, January 22, 1910",United States,D.W. Griffith,D.W.

tt0001182,A Dixie Mother,1910.0,,,"Drama,Short","Whether ""A Dixie Mother"" will live up to advance opinion it deserves to be called great. It will easily take a high position among dramas of the year because of its many fine qualities, and it deserves praise because plays of that sort answer captious criticism, and many like them would do away with censorship altogether. The fact that it is evenly balanced in the requisites of success makes it difficult to say whether it excels in inspiration, in acting or in scenic effect, but it may safely be pronounced eminent in each respect. Very few dramatists and still fewer novelists have successfully depicted the American woman as she really is. She is so complex that she evades analysis. In ""A Dixie Mother,"" however, she is a pure type. It would be difficult to name a nobler type of American woman than the Southern wife and mother during the Civil War. Northern mothers made equally noble sacrifices during the war, but, after it was all over, the sad burden of defeat fell on the shoulders of her Southern sister. The sentiment of the picture hovers around this beautiful central figure and is clearly shown in nearly every one of the many stirring and affecting scenes, scenes true to life. ""A Dixie Mother"" is strong as a character portrayal. The central character is not a forced one. Only once does the enraged mother show a strain of tigerish ferocity, when she picks out the man who killed her youngest son almost before her eyes. The rest of the portrayal is one of fortitude, great courage under affliction, deprivation and danger. Her eldest son is wounded and taken prisoner, her despairing husband is also terribly wounded, she has a helpless household on her hands, but she neither fails nor falters. After the war is over, the Dixie mother is a gentle creature and shows another kind of fortitude in the patient way that she confronts hardship and privation. There is no change in her enduring affection for her family, but her husband refuses to become reconciled to a union of the North and the South that has produced a new generation. The new generation is typified by her eldest son's baby waving the old flag. Heartbroken over this after-hatred, the mother begs and entreats in vain. Then her proud spirit breaks at last. She is on the verge of mental dissolution and death when her irreconcilable husband relents. When he does yield, it is by no half measures. He surrenders to the new generation with such old-time chivalry that we smile through our tears. ""A Dixie Mother"" is a master stroke of genius. This kind of a picture will be far reaching in its influence and a popular one for the South and of especial interest to the whole country. We are not alone in these opinions and inform the trade that they may not miss this wonderful ""Life Portrayal."" - The Moving Picture World, November 26, 1910",United States,Van Dyke Brooke,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001182/,short,1910,10

But different faces will appear and each individual will live over again his own school days and the pleasant memories will blend with the picture on the screen until somehow it will be the old school reproduced and revivified and all sense of the present will be lost as the reminiscences of the past will overwhelm and encompass him round about. - The Moving Picture World, October 15, 1910",United States,D.W.

It is one of those heart stories which have such a direct appeal that one cannot escape from its fascination, nor forget its impression. The downward course, suggested by its results, rather than told direct, the relenting of the grandfather and the final dramatic scene where father, son and grandson meet, the son to face recognition as the grandson is admitted to the University Club. Description conveys no adequate conception of the power and beauty of this unusually satisfactory picture. Not only is it an entertaining story; it is a powerful incentive to right living in that it illustrates too graphically to be mistaken the influence of evil associations.

tt0001211,Faust,1910.0,5.5,51,"Drama,Short","This is the old story which has been handed down to us from time immemorial, and which was woven into a drama by Goethe and set to music by Gounod. The story of Faust and his temptation by the devil is so well known as to render a repetition of the story unnecessary. The film follows closely the Goethe dramatization, and is magnificent in its scenery, action and coloring. Like Il Trovatore, the music has been arranged to suit the film, scene for scene, and, with the musical accompaniment, forms a spectacle unequaled in the world of motion pictures. Faust is shown in his study, tired of life. Mephistopheles tempts him, shows him Marguerite, and offers to restore Faust's youth if he will sign away his soul. Other scenes show Faust at the Kirmess; show him changed to a youth again; show his love-making to Marguerite, his duel with her brother; Marguerite's final arrest, the loss of reason and death, and finally Mephistopheles claiming her soul. Undoubtedly this film will make a tremendous impression, and be thoroughly enjoyed by everyone who witnesses it. - The Moving Picture World, June 17, 1911",France,Henri Andréani,Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001211/,short,1910,18

Th chase of the cowboys after the flying automobile is thrilling, but it must be confessed that one permits a sigh of relief to escape when the car breaks down and Dorothy is rescued from her dangerous position.

tt0001237,The Golden Supper,1910.0,4.8,82,"Romance,Short","I'm going to skip the synopsis I usually do, because this attempt to bring Tennyson's fantasy poem to the screen is muddled and obscure. Instead I will concentrate on the technical issues.First there's the acting. Although 1909 had seen Griffith establishing a more restrained style of mime for the movie screen, occasionally he would retreat to the older, bigger, ridiculous-in-context, stagy style for a work he considered appropriate. This is one of those times, and it comes off as overwrought and bizarre.Next there is the location shooting. Biograph was based in Manhattan and the location shoots substitute various Manhattan locations for medieval Italy. While the contemporary viewer might have been fooled, or even the modern viewer, unfamiliar with the local architecture; for me it was a constantly jarring realization that some one seems to think that the Brunsonia apartment building is in northern Italy.These issues make this movie ridiculous. There is, however, the issue of point of view shots from odd locations. These imbue the proceedings with an air of unreality: not seeing things from the usual angle of somewhere in front of the proceedings and on the same level, makes these events seem even odder. That is an effect that would be used by film makers in the future.It's rare for me to admit that a D.W. Griffith movie is a waste of time. This is one of those occasions.

A stubborn father, through unreasoning pride, brings much sorrow and many a heartache to his family. When he and his devoted wife are finally driven from their home to the poorhouse he becomes an object of contempt, a common ending of the proud. Then the disowned daughter comes to their rescue and succeeds in subduing her father's pride and thereby re-unites the family. The story is suggestive and causes those who see the film to apply the rule to their own experience, or, perhaps, the experience of someone they have known.

Not much of a story; in fact, there is no story, and that is just where this picture silhouettes itself out from the usual thing and gives us the consoling thought that the era of the picture is not on the wane and the illimitable field of subjects has yet been barely scratched. Yes, there is still hope when a picture maker can take up such a threadbare theme and build upon it a twenty minutes' panorama of human emotions so deftly portrayed and so enthralling that at the end the blasé audience in the old Union Square Theater breaks into loud applause. There is no straining after effect, simply skillful portrayal and natural action. Only in the closing scene is there any strong appeal to the emotions, when the lonesome child discovers the baby in her sister's arms and is requested to stay with the new playmate.

Often the dissatisfied working man has what the man of wealth would give all he has to possess. The difficulty is to make the dissatisfied iconoclast understand this. If the poor man could be made to understand the griefs and heartaches and sorrows which often surround the wealthy the way this man found it, anarchism and the worst forms of socialism would cease. A picture which does so much to clear up a misunderstanding has a reason for existence far beyond the mere matter of amusement. The man entered the house to murder. He left it with a chastened spirit and a clearer comprehension of the heartaches that trouble the rich. And he went back to his home and his work, convinced that his lot was not bad and that he might make it better if he would. It is a sermon in ethics and it deserves wide circulation so its teaching may reach to the confines of the country. - The Moving Picture World, October 15, 1910",United States,D.W.

As adults, the son (Henry B. Walthall) goes to become a priest while the daughter (Stephanie Longfellow) runs off with a bad man and soon finds herself in trouble. The son keeps his promise of visiting the grave of his mother but the daughter doesn't follow suit. This isn't the best film to come from Griffith but it at least features some pretty good performances with Walthall leading the way. He manages to pass off emotions without ever going over the top and he really manages to put in a lot of heart to the character. Nichols also manages to be pretty good in his part as is Charles West in a supporting bit. Longfellow on the other hand is pretty forgettable in the role of the daughter and this does bring the film down a few notches considering she has perhaps the most important part here. Fans of the director will want to look quickly for his first wife in a small role. Griffith handles the material quite well as its nothing he wasn't use to but the screenplay really isn't all that special and there's not enough backbone to back up all the preaching.",United States,D.W.

The story becomes absorbing as the film passes, and the complications increase. Then comes the end, a denouement as unexpected as it is interesting. The acting is sympathetic and leads up to the end in a way that holds the attention closely to the last. The photography is clear, adding much to the pleasure the picture excites. The Edison scheme of toning the film different colors might be open to question if it were not used with so much discretion. As it is now done it adds to most films and sometimes one fancies it is a relief to the eye. One color may, under some circumstances, become monotonous, though this would never occur with an interesting film.

Whatever may be thought of this type of picture individually, the power it exerts upon an audience cannot be questioned. Like the horrible examples graphically shown in the goody-goody Sunday school books these films possess a fascination which cannot be denied, yet perhaps few would care to acknowledge its influence. The dramatic attractiveness in this particular instance consists in reproducing a domestic scene, unhappily too common, in some of its aspects at least, in such a way that the events seem to be transpiring before the audience.

These two little ones insist upon seeing the president of the trust that ruined their father. The loss of the money was not what worried them, but they couldn't quite understand why their father was so indifferent to them. So when they found out they decided to take matters into their own hands and settle them, which they did in satisfactory fashion. Usually the child wins, and in this instance, while it may seem much overdrawn, it is merely another graphic illustration of the fact which everyone understands is true. When they bear home the letter from the trust president the consternation may be imagined. It is useless to undertake to describe anything like this.

The supposed setting in Japan, too, was obviously filmed at a studio--presumably Vitagraph's one in New York.

Sometimes the maternal tenderness of a mother leads her into indiscretions regarding her son, and in this instance that appears to be the source of the difficulties which befall the young man. But when he robs his father a change occurs and he departs to begin anew elsewhere. The picture itself is not so powerful, perhaps, as what it suggests; but it is this subtle influence, this feeling that one has known similar cases that makes it even more dramatic than it might otherwise be. Maybe the producer had no intention of sermonizing, but he did. nevertheless, and he could scarcely have selected a more appealing subject. - The Moving Picture World, July 9, 1910",United States,D.W.

Rut the horse took him to his father's camp. He was identified, proclaimed and immediately took measures to secure the princess for his bride, in which he succeeded. Few films are more fascinating than this. It is followed with the most absorbing interest, and one feels a thrill of pleasure when Mazeppa and the princes are re-united.

tt0001315,The Message of the Violin,1910.0,5.8,26,"Drama,Short","More than once have the tones of the violin told over again the tale of love and reunited hearts which had been separated for one reason or another. The love story here is more of the type one meets with in the ordinary workaday world than many that have been reproduced and for that reason it may arouse a stronger feeling of sympathy with the audience. It deals with two typical young people of the East Side who were thrown much together in early life. Then comes the separation, not because a parent violently objects, they don't often do that excepting in highly romantic novels, but because business seems to make it advisable. However, even though the girl is made suddenly wealthy, the young man is given an opportunity to prove what is in him. This touch is particularly modern. That is exactly what the father of almost any girl would do, and as this one follows the course that would generally be adopted in real life, it makes the picture all the more interesting. The denouement, when the rendering of an old melody by the violinist at a reception shatters the prospects of a baron, is the only really romantic situation in the piece; and perhaps that could be true. It is, however, the only point where the drama has departed from the ordinary run of daily life, and it adds a touch which shows how close the run of ordinary living is to the homely life of every day. Something about this drama appeals to the common sense of the average person. It depicts a series of events such as might happen in the life of almost any couple in America. The girl's sudden elevation to wealth has happened over and over again. Most Americans can almost duplicate this among their acquaintances. The young man's success in music. You can see something similar around you daily. These two points seem to emphasize the purely American quality of the drama. - The Moving Picture World, November 5, 1910",United States,D.W.

It is illustrative of a trait in the character of a Mexican which may or may not be true, but which, nevertheless, adds interest to the picture. One objection to the film is the carrying off of a girl. It is not pleasant to see even pictured insults, and it would be quite as well for the motion picture industry, and the influence of the motion picture, if such scenes were relegated to the background along with the murders and suicides which rioted across the screens some months ago. They add no touch that is beneficial and they are distinctly objectionable to a great many people. Otherwise this film has much to commend it, in dramatic quality, acting and photography.

In the instance illustrated the girl accepts what seems to her the only alternative, and yet fate was unkind to her, since the matter could have been made right had her lover remained near her for only a few hours longer. Possibly this film may seem unreal to some, yet it is unquestionably far too real, and far too true to real life to make it pleasant for many who will see it.

tt0001347,Ononko's Vow,1910.0,,,"Drama,Short","One of the most elaborate Indian pictures ever put on the screen. It is a story of the famous massacre at Deerfield, Mass., in 1765 and 1764. All exterior scenes were made in and about Deerfield and they faithfully reproduce the scenery in Summer and Winter. It is well, too, that views of this magnificent old town have been made permanent. It is one of the few historic towns which have not been injured by time and the ruthless renovator. The colonial houses still line the principal street, none of them rebuilt or destroyed and the great shade trees still overarch the streets, massive, magnificent, unsurpassed. It was a cruel massacre. History says that, and records of the wanderings and sufferings of the prisoners prove the assertions of history. An incident in the early colonial wars, it has remained as one of the landmarks of the struggle in settlement and freedom. There is a heart interest which holds one's attention and arouses the emotions. There are thrilling scenes when the war whoop of the Indian, the crackling flames of the burning buildings and the shrieks of those who are suffering at the hands of the Indians can be heard, so vividly is the story told. It brings graphically before one something of the dangers which menaced even as considerable a village as Deerfield and it emphasizes anew what it cost to make this land a fit habitation for the millions that are now here, films like this perform a service of importance. They instruct, and, at the same time, they impress upon those who see them something of the conditions which existed during the struggle for a new home in the wilderness and later in wresting freedom from a stubborn king. - The Moving Picture World, October 15, 1910",United States,Frank McGlynn Sr.,Bret Harte,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001347/,short,1910,

tt0001354,Pals of the Range,1910.0,,,"Short,Western","A Western story which contains much of human nature, which in one who is weak asserts itself in treachery. The story centers around a girl who is loved by two pals, but when they both propose and she accepts one the other cannot refrain from taking advantage and making his pal appear like the rejected one. Then comes a prospecting journey into the desert by the disappointed suitor and a wedding of the others. But even as murder will out so this treachery haunts the perpetrator so seriously that he tells his new wife and she, burning with indignation, sends him out into the desert to find the wronged man. Then come Indian fights, and ultimately the wronged man is rescued and returns to civilization, but the treacherous pal pays the penalty of his misdeeds with his life. Perhaps if there had not been so many Western pictures with mix-ups in love affairs this would be a very attractive film, but inasmuch as it is only one in a long train it is not particularly exciting. Whether the field is worked out, or whether producers have grown somewhat careless, the Western pictures have a certain degree of sameness and monotony which is fatal to sustained interest. This is no worse than the bulk of them. There is nothing about it which stamps it as being much better. The acting of the Essanay company is always good and their deportment does not suffer here; but the man who has little to do can't be expected to accomplish really great things in any line. It holds good in acting for motion pictures quite as forcibly as in any other thing. - The Moving Picture World, November 5, 1910",United States,Gilbert M. 'Broncho Billy' Anderson,Gilbert M.

The only point of special interest in the story is the finding of the outlaw hidden in the loft by the girl by means of a drop of blood which flows from his wound and strikes the sheriff on the hand. This incident has been used once before, and if memory serves right, twice. Hence it is not entirely novel. At the same time it is interesting and perhaps serves its purpose in this instance quite as well as it would have done if it were new. Apparently most of the principal events have been used in this flood of Western pictures and it is small wonder if an effective scene like this is used more than once. - The Moving Picture World, October 15, 1910",United States,Gilbert M.

One follows the adventures of the lovers with almost breathless interest, and rejoices with them when they kneel on the shore after leaving the noisome prison and escaping from the buffeting waves.

It is not a particularly pleasing story, yet its plain teaching is that men can overcome early evil associations and become useful citizens. It offers numerous suggestions for reformatory work, and withal, should be a very helpful film. - The Moving Picture World, July 16, 1910",United States,D.W. Griffith,Stanner E.V.

If anyone had told the victim- of this villain's schemes that the very thing which apparently ruined them would bring them wealth, they would have laughed at it, or would have deemed it altogether impossible. The only weak point in the story, or the only point which one might wish different, is that in which the speculator, in no wise interested in the lovers' quarrel, loses his money. Possibly, however, the end may justify this slight deviation from what seems the correct path.

In this case, authority casts a lecherous eye upon Dorothy West, but she will not give way, so she and her mother are found guilty of being witches. Happily, trapper Henry Walthall and his Indian buddies rescue her.Griffith has pretty much settled on his methods of cross-cutting of simultaneous action to increase tension -- in this case they're getting ready to burn Dorothy at the stake for being a witch while Henry is rousing the Indians and leading them to her rescue. But he also visibly compresses time for maximum effect, and it becomes a tad bizarre. That's what happens when you're experimenting with techniques towards regularizing cinema's grammar: you try something and it doesn't necessarily work.Walthall and West are a bit overwrought.

The moral results of neglect cannot be depicted at such an early age, yet they are often more serious than the physical. This picture has little or no dramatic strength, but it depicts, with extraordinary fidelity to facts, numerous domestic scenes. Probably everyone can recall instances similar to this and not a few will wish that certain individuals of whom they are reminded could see it. It may, in a way, apply to substantially everyone, since all children sometimes seem to become troublesome and worry their parents. The picture, while not possessing any claims to dramatic power beyond that which is inherent in the subject will, nevertheless, make a profound impression, because it touches upon something which appeals directly to every home. It is one of the strongest sermons upon the neglect of children that has come out in a long time. - The Moving Picture World, August 27, 1910",United States,D.W. Griffith,William J.

A priest is accused of the murder, but because the murderer confessed to him he cannot tell the truth. And the girl, after exonerating the priest, repairs to a convent to expiate her share in the tragedy by service in the church. There is some wildly picturesque scenery, well worth seeing. There is no question about the strength of the picture, nor of the dramatic qualities of the story, of which a well balanced company of sympathetic actors nave made the most.

When the sheriff secures the evidence he allows the man to go free, and even contributes money to put him on his feet because of a girl in the case. It is a type of sacrifice which is unquestionably open to serious objections. Yet it seems so human, and so like a man whose blood runs red. that the fault can be condoned, even though it appears to be a dangerous precedent.

Insanity, murder, self-destruction are not pleasant features to contemplate even though they are presented with extraordinary dramatic power. Unfaithfulness is presented in what is probably its true light, and while its consequences are not always so tragic, they are serious enough in all cases to make them abhorrent. One death, perhaps two, in this picture was due to haste. While the picture teaches the disaster that follows unfaithfulness, it also teaches the dangers of haste. Explanations are often possible in cases of this sort and had one man investigated before he acted there might have been two deaths less. On the other hand, while the film clearly lays the blame on the girl, there are those who will say that she had a right to change, that no wedding ceremony had been performed and that she had a right to renounce her vows if she chose. The picture raises a nice question in ethics which can scarcely be satisfactorily answered without careful consideration, and then opinions will differ.

Here is a city man who a country in a huff, falls in love with the little country girl in the same old way, and then—well, the lure of the city is too strong, he goes back to his former sweetheart, leaving the country shepherdess to fill her grandfather's pipe and chase her sheep across the bridge as of yore. Of course she cries a bit. It needs a few tears to express the shattered emotion, but she accepts the inevitable with good grace and cuddles under her grandfather's wing in a very satisfactory and re-assuring way. So much for the story. The pictorial part is notable. The farm scenes were made while the farm operations were in progress. The harvesting scenes are faithful reproductions. The only criticism the writer has to offer is that the horses haul that reaper and binder faster than they do when actually at work. The machine would not stand such rapid motion. It couldn't. The reciprocating motion of the knife would tear the machine to pieces if it went long at that pace. The scene where they are loading the grain is an excellent reproduction. It is a picture worthy preservation. The man on the load knew what he was doing, he loaded the bundles right. Some farm scenes are carelessly composed, and not infrequently are wrong, but these deserve commendation for their accuracy. The tones in the picture are excellent. There it no soot and whitewash, but a soft gradation which is good to see and adds much to the pictorial effect. It is a notable production. And yet, it must go at the close of a day while poor vaudeville acts stay on. - The Moving Picture World, September 17, 1910",United States,D.W. Griffith,Stanner E.V.

Probably the innovation of having bull pups chase umpires all over the grounds will not become popular, particularly with the luckless umpires, but in this instance it adds another feature of fun to a film already overflowing with it.

Like all Biograph pictures, the story is remarkably well told and there isn't a dull moment from the beginning to the end. The acting of the hero, the innocent minister, is as well adapted to the peculiar part as it possibly can be, and at the climax, when he receives his $500 and the hand of the girl, one almost wants to hurrah with the rest of the cowboys. - The Moving Picture World, May 7, 1910",United States,Frank Powell,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001413/,short,1910,
tt0001414,That Chink at Golden Gulch,1910.0,5.5,84,"Short,Western","This one-reeler isn't quite as bad as it sounds with a title that includes a racial slur and as directed by D. W. Griffith, the same who went on to make the racist epic ""The Birth of a Nation"" (1915). I've seen quite a lot of Griffith's oeuvre, though, and it seems that films such as this Biograph short may be a better representation of his muddled racial views than the perverted history he adapted from Thomas Dixon and President Woodrow Wilson for his most notorious feature. Sure, it's still based in stereotypes and ultimately supports the white-supremacist system, but it's against racial violence, and the racial ""other"" is depicted with some sensitivity--albeit in yellowface and in melodramatic fashion where racial minorities or the poor must always sacrifice themselves for the well being of the higher-class white couples. So many melodramas do this; it's a big trope. This time, the character devotes himself to aiding his white saviors, who stopped a bunch of cowboys from shooting at him. The title card mocking ""2,000 years of civilization"" for the white characters is a nice bit of sarcasm from 1910, though.Basically, the supposed Chinese man depicted here is like the ""faithful souls"" in ""The Birth of a Nation,"" the black slaves who remain loyal to their masters even after nominal emancipation. That seems to be how Griffith most often handled non-white characters, or he otherwise employed them in minstrel-show type comic relief (the blackface in ""One Exciting Night"" (1922), e.g.). Such shorts as ""His Trust"" and ""His Trust Fulfilled"" (both 1911) do the same thing with an African-American character as this one does with the Chinese one, or as Griffith would do again with the Chinese character in ""Broken Blossoms"" (1919). The genre conventions of melodrama that Griffith advocated surely dictate much of this. In addition to African Americans, the depiction of Native Americans in his films could vary from relatively sensitive if stereotypical to offensively violent depending on the genre dictates of the white characters' plight--whether being attacked by a tribe in ""The Battle at Elderbush Gulch"" (1913) or condemning Indian removal in ""The Red Man's View"" (1909).Otherwise, this isn't one of Griffith's more technically-sophisticated pictures, either. The editing, including some crosscutting, is relatively quick for the era, if not necessarily for Griffith, though. That especially stands out to me now since I've just finished watching a bunch of Alice Guy's Solax productions. Her being a director more in what one might term the European mode or tableau tradition focused on mise-en-scene over montage, and Griffith being the opposite--the so-called pioneer of the American way.",United States,D.W.

The film is admirably composed and satisfactorily staged, while photography is clear enough to make it seem almost real. This picture should be an influential assistant to the health board in every community and help the tuberculosis committee in their laudable efforts to restrict the ravages of the white plague.

It isn't always possible to explain these longings, common to all mankind. The Biograph Company has expressed them strongly in this picture, pointing out in an unusually graphic manner the human tendency in the young orphan girl's heart. Next follows the love story, beautiful and romantic, and the interposition of the picturesque Western touch. The villain is satisfactorily foiled, however, and the lonely girl strolls away with her new husband, the previous unexplained longings satisfied. The scenery, representing the San Gabriel valley, is beautiful, while acting and photography are both of a high standard.

In fact, it is the first time an American company has attempted anything of the kind in drama, and in this respect the production must be considered as something of an experiment. Pathé used two reels to produce Drink, from Zola's novel, and we may conclude that the result was not any too favorable, for we have had no other double reels from that company. The Vitagraph took two reels to give us the life of Napoleon, two for Washington, and five for Moses, but these were not dramas. At any rate, the result will be watched with interest, although it will not be safe for producers to argue if three reels of Uncle Tom prove popular that the same thing can be done with other plays. Uncle Tom was always an exception on the stage and may prove so in motion pictures.... As a whole the film must prove notable, but there is one suggestion that occurs with respect to its issue on three separate days. There should be a caption at the end of reel one and two stating that there would be a continuation of the drama on other reels.""",United States,J.

Perhaps the attempt is successful in that it will be understood by those familiar with the picture and the poem. But what about those who are unfamiliar with them? Several near the writer were heard to ask what it all meant, and the probability is strong that many others are in much the same position. It is artistic, it is beautiful in the literary quality it possesses, but it is scarcely plain enough to be understood by the average person in an audience.

tt0001445,Waiter No. 5,1910.0,,,"Drama,Short","A dramatic picture dealing with the downtrodden poor in Russia, then suddenly transferred to America as the principal actors are forced to fly from their native country because of revolutionary tendencies. The scenes among the poor are harrowing enough to arouse the most generous impulses and cause one to believe the unpleasant criticisms of the Czar. This portion of the film will attract attention. Then comes the appearance of the former chief of police as a waiter in a city restaurant in America, where, unknown to everyone but his wife, he works continuously until his son is old enough to marry. Some trouble develops then, but it is quickly swept away by the timely arrival of the Czar's pardon for whatever misconduct might have occurred in earlier years. The change from one country to another and the excellent acting in each of the parts do much to make this film attractive, yet it must be admitted that it is not up to the standard which has been set and generally followed by the Biograph people. - The Moving Picture World, November 19, 1910",United States,D.W.

tt0001446,The Way of the World,1910.0,6.4,18,"Drama,Short","This remarkable play, presented as a lesson in Christian charity, was received by a mixed audience with a spontaneous outburst of applause. Such approval is rarely shown after a motion picture exhibition by an audience of that character, and indicates a keen appreciation of what is truly artistic in moving pictures. The bell tolls in an old tower but there is no response in the hearts of the people. The sanctuary is deserted, the altar is veiled, the lamps are extinguished, and the heart of the old priest is depressed. A young priest goes out among the toilers and revelers and tries to lead them into the fold by imitating Christ's example. He meets with hardened selfishness among those laboring for a livelihood, and insufferable egotism among those engaged in the pursuit of pleasure. He returns completely discouraged, but is followed by a Magdalene of today, a woman as ""despised and rejected of men"" as was the greatest character in human history. The church fails because it considers what we have been, and not what we are, but the aged priest finds pathetic consolation, the effort was not in vain if one soul was saved. This simple and poetic idea seemed to reach dull hearts, and its exquisite presentation is creditable to author, actors and producers alike. Thoughtful persons who see this film will ask the question seriously, is this, or is this not ""The Way of the World"" before it disappears from the screen and its memory will haunt them many an hour afterward. It is a graphic sermon, a sermon so strong and preached with such a direct appeal that one can scarcely shake off its influence. Do those busily engaged in the work of the world turn away from the proffers of good? Do those in the lower depths of degradation also turn away? One almost answers yes to this silent question, and yet, even here, one penitent was found, and perhaps in the actual world the proportion would be even greater. One doesn't like to condemn the world. It is not all self-absorbed. It is not all given to degrading pursuits. There are many unselfish people who are ready to pause in their work and aid others; and even in resorts like the one depicted there are some who are not bad. At least, one may harbor the comforting thought without danger of receiving an impression that is far wrong. The setting of the picture is particularly good. The San Gabriel Mission in California is utilized as a background. - The Moving Picture World, May 7, 1910",United States,D.W. Griffith,Stanner E.V.

tt0001466,'Tween Two Loves,1911.0,,,"Drama,Romance,Short","The story does not reveal much of interest. But the producer and the performers have deftly clothed the skeleton with the habiliments of life until every scene throbs with the realities of human existence. Much is to be said of the completeness of the scenic effects and of the good photography, which contribute to the excellence of this picture in no small degree, but it is the unmistakable touch of human interest, at times most absorbing, upon which its claim for consideration most solidly rests. Much good photography and expensive settings have been wasted upon lifeless situations, but no such charge can be brought against this production. Though a commonplace chapter from the book of life it is not without its thrilling moments. When the mother enters the burning house to rescue her baby, one fairly holds one's breath until she staggers out with the child in her arms. This scene has been ably handled, the simulation of a house on fire being so real that one fairly trembles for the safety of the mother as she gropes her way to the cradle through the smoke. Indeed, one almost forgets that it is a picture. As portrayed the story makes a strong demand upon the sympathies. The girl and her lover are not to be denied their happiness, yet one cannot fully condemn the lonely father who has lost the one object of his love, his only daughter. It is a selfish trait of human nature, but one that is of frequent occurrence. But, if the father seems to be unnecessarily obdurate, it must be remembered that the man who wishes to marry his daughter is but a farm hand, possibly unknown to him, in which case he would be justified in opposing the marriage to the last. The character depicted being the stolid, determined type of man, it follows naturally that he should refuse to forgive and to answer the appeal of his daughter in her moment of dire need. Such unrelenting characters are not unknown, albeit they seem to be extremely severe. That he has a heart, proof is given in the final scene, when father and daughter are once more united. There is a noticeable absence of superfluous sentimentality with which some producers would burden a story of this kind. Only one discreet love scene is given, for which the producer has our thanks. There is also a death scene which is robbed of much of the customary horrors by the omission of the agonizing throes of final dissolution, a treatment of an unpleasant subject that is highly commendable. As a whole, the production is of the highest class and marks a distinct advance in the character of the work of the Imp Company. - The Moving Picture World, September 16, 1911",United States,Thomas H.

If the photoplay is looked upon as an accurate description of life of course this scene must be considered too unreal to be included. If, however, the story of the picture is to be considered as the principal feature, then this incident assists in holding interest. It must be admitted that the average audience will enjoy the thrill which this scene affords without analyzing the possibilities of it too closely. The fight at the shack is not improbable. In fact, the same thing has been done a good many times before, while the appearance of the ranchmen and the beating off of the Indians are but incidents which have been many times repeated. That an audience will be pleased with this picture is certain. The improbability of the thrilling race in the first scenes will not mar the enjoyment of the story excepting in a few people. - The Moving Picture World, April 15, 1911",United States,Gilbert M.

The picture shows that he kept his promise. The Biograph players and producers have done much to hold it above petty realism by very praiseworthy art. It is not a very cheerful picture. - The Moving Picture World, December 30, 1911",United States,D.W. Griffith,George Hennessy,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001482/,short,1911,30

tt0001485,At the Duke's Command,1911.0,,,"Drama,Romance,Short","An elaborately staged subject, containing thrilling moments and situations that make the audience almost gasp so realistically are they done. It is the first time that the old time torture chamber and its horrors have been utilized in compelling a girl to sacrifice herself for the benefit of her lover, but the dramatic way in which she succeeds in discouraging the duke's attentions wins for her the lasting regard of the audience. And then her lover, released from his tortures, does what the duke did not expect him to do, leads the girl away despite the disfigurement of her once beautiful face. This picture made a deep impression upon the audience. It is so clear and the story is made so plain that it cannot be misunderstood. The Imp company has achieved a success which will continue as long as this picture is shown. Even though the torture chamber is gruesome and the girl's sacrifice is horrible, the effect upon the audience is to increase their interest and when the young man leads the girl away they are quite ready to applaud. - The Moving Picture World, February 18, 1911",United States,Thomas H.

tt0001489,The Awakening of John Bond,1911.0,,,"Drama,Short","It is a film with a mission, and a very worthy one. Its principal object is to disseminate information as to what becomes of the money that is received from the sale of Red Cross Stamps at holiday time. Incidentally it teaches a lesson to selfish property owners who neglect everything about their tenement properties except the collection of rents. John Bond was such a man. He didn't care the snap of his finger how many unfortunate souls lived and died of dread consumption in his tenements; all he wanted was rent, until one day his selfishness was brought directly home to him and he began to see things in another light. The story is cleverly put together and is exceedingly well acted in the best Edison fashion. The plot has to do with the dealings of John Bond with the O'Brien family, who were tubercular tenants of his. Their unfortunate condition was a matter of indifference to him. One day John Bond took unto himself a bride. On the same day George O'Brien shipped as a common seaman on Bond's yacht, which was used for the honeymoon. On the voyage young O'Brien succumbed to the ravages of tuberculosis. During his last illness Mrs. Bond nursed the young man and contracted the disease herself, and from that time on John Bond was obliged to view the tuberculosis question from quite a different angle than before. Step by step we observe the awakening of John Bond. The picture becomes intensely dramatic as it proceeds. The big dramatic scene is when Nellie O'Brien calls by request upon Mrs. Bond to receive the trinkets bequeathed by her brother in care of that very good lady. There in his mansion Nellie comes face to face with her heartless landlord. The sight of him is sufficient to send the girl into hysterics, and Mrs. Bond becomes aware of how her husband's money is really made; after which she takes a hand in the matter and assists in his awakening. The work of Mary Fuller as Nellie O'Brien is a masterpiece. At the beginning a perfect portrayal of quiet submission, it changes in a flash to the violent outpouring of a burdened soul. Seldom do we see such splendid examples of dynamics as this one. John Bond was typical and well personified by Bigelow Cooper. George O'Brien was a short but well- acted part by Harold M. Shaw. Mrs. Bond was done by Miriam Nesbitt, leaving nothing to be desired. - The Moving Picture World, November 18, 1911",United States,Oscar Apfel,Bannister Merwin,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001489/,short,1911,

This rouses the jealousy of the husband. The author receives a telegram to come home. To go the long way would mean missing his train, so the woman volunteers to pilot him a shorter, but more dangerous way. The husband returns during her absence and suspecting they have eloped starts after them. The wife returns soon afterward and learning of the state of affairs starts again on a wild ride to avert tragedy, which, happily, she accomplishes, reaching the station before anything serious happens.

It is the same Western idea, developed in a different way, perhaps, only monotonous because so many others have carried out substantially the same thing. Nothing can be said against the actors, and the staging is satisfactory, but it is a repetition of what has been done before which becomes, in time, uninteresting. Besides, this type of westerner has disappeared, and in his place has come a prosperous individual whose opulence precludes any possibility of his reverting to the old cow-punching days.

tt0001497,The Battle of Bunker Hill,1911.0,7.7,13,"Short,War","This is the third in the series of historical pictures the Edison Company is releasing from time to time. It is good, but not so good as the two that have preceded it. The picture of .the battle is what might be called a full-faced picture and it isn't effective. This is due mostly to the fact that there are very few British soldiers and also that there are too many actors among the Americans who seem not deeply interested in the outcome of the event. The love story also might have been acted a little more convincingly. It is hard for a grown actor to play the part of a bashful youth pleasingly. The hero of the incident is played by a good actor, but one watching him, longs to have him straighten up and make love like an officer and a gentleman. - The Moving Picture World, August 26, 1911",United States,Oscar Apfel,Clyde Fitch,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001497/,short,1911,
tt0001498,The Battle of Trafalgar,1911.0,8.2,18,War,"The Battle of Trafalgar, arresting as it did the power of Napoleon, just when that power seemed to develop into omnipotence, is justly counted among the fifteen decisive battles of history. A film maker, who undertakes to reproduce an event of such importance in moving pictures, deserves encouragement for the effort alone. It may be added at the outset that the effort of the Edison Company was altogether creditable. The picture has bits of historic realism that are quite clever. The ""fighting top"" of the enemy's ship ""The Redoubtable"" was an extremely well-conceived and well executed scene and has the merit of being in the story of it well sustained by historical tradition. The scene on board the ""Victory"" when, after so many hours of bloody fighting the fortunes of war went with the British, is stirring in the picture, as it must have been in reality. The death of Nelson was an affecting scene and to an Englishman must bring to mind one of the proudest moments in the history of his country. The appearance of Nelson before the Board of Admiralty is likewise worthy of special mention. The psychological moment has been seized by the director, and the spectator at the end of the scene feels that Nelson is going forth to conquer or to die. Special credit is due to the film maker for abstaining from the ""love-fiction"" too often interwoven with so- called historical pictures. The historical novel has been the pet aversion of literature and it would be too bad to have a revival of it on the screen. The educational value of the picture is great. - The Moving Picture World, September 9, 1911",United States,J. Searle Dawley,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001498/,movie,1911,51

tt0001506,The Black Arrow,1911.0,,,"Drama,Short","A Tale of love and adventure, with the War of the Roses as an historical background and the ""English Greenwood""' as its prevailing setting, is surely not unwelcome after the monotonous procession of impossible sheriffs, impossible Indians and impossible cowboys which seem to haunt so many studios. ""The Black Arrow"" is an adaptation for the silent stage of the popular story of Robert Louis Stevenson. The story was originally intended and written for young folks and the picture will undoubtedly make a special appeal to the younger generation, for its hero is a boy and its heroine a girl. The work of adaptation presented difficulties, which few can realize unless they have read the book of Stevenson. As in all of his stories, there is in ""The Black Arrow"" much fine and graphic description and a variety of incident, not always closely connected with the central theme. An attempt to give the patron of the moving picture all the ramifications of the plot or even a complete portrayal of all its principal characters would have been impossible of achievement within the narrow limits of a thousand feet. The adapter has wisely avoided this temptation and in simplifying with considerable skill the plot, has by that means been able to transfer to the screen the greatest charms of the whole story: the spell of the ""greenwood,"" the spirit of romance and chivalry and the hard yet picturesque fighting, for which the wars of York and Lancaster will ever be famous in English history. The plot in its simplified form deals with the love of a likely young lad, ""Dick Shelton,"" for a very brave and very sweet girl, ""Joanna Sedley."" A wicked knight, ""Sir Daniel Brackley,"" is the obstacle in the course of true love. Being not only a bad guardian, but a ruthless tyrant and oppressor as well, he has rendered himself hateful to the people of his neighborhood, who as an answer to his acts of cruelty and robbery have formed themselves into a sort of medieval vigilance committee and are called ""Black Arrows,"" many of them being skilled archers, sending vengeful shafts into the hearts of their enemies, who are Sir Daniel and his retainers. There are escapes and rescues and fights aplenty, but it all ends happily; the ""Black Arrows"" punish the despotic knight and the young people get married with every promise of a long and happy life. One of the features of the reel is the great number of fine outdoor settings, remarkable for beauty of nature and splendor of photography, even in this day of good outdoor settings. The pursuit of Joanna and the scene entitled ""The Last Black Arrow"" are instances to the point and cannot fail to please, thrill and charm. The scenes in the greenwood, where ""Dick"" joins the brotherhood, sworn to destroy Sir Daniel, is superb in setting and grouping. The second feature has to do with the brilliant battle scenes, which in point of armor and weapons and in realistic acting, as well as in the number of the combatants, have scarcely been equaled on this side of the water. The attack on Shoreby Town is a masterpiece, the realism is intense, it is spirited in action and brings to mind scenes from the canvas of an old master. It adds not a little to the merit of this truly notable picture, that the principal character is taken by an artist, who showed a fine conception of the part and who knew how to execute his conception in so perfect a manner. Harold Shaw was a ""Dick Shelton"" after Stevenson's own heart and fancy; he was youthful, yet manly; an admirable lover and a loyal partisan. The part of Joanna was well and understandingly acted by Natalie Jerome, while Charles Ogle gave a good impersonation of the wicked Sir Daniel. Exhibitors will welcome such reels as ""The Black Arrow."" They attract the best and most desirable class of patronage and serve to increase the respect of the intelligent public for the moving picture, its destiny and its possibilities. - The Moving Picture World, October 21, 1911",United States,Oscar Apfel,Charles M.

Indeed, it hasn't a dull moment, though the scene where the knight of the road agrees to take the secret papers from the messenger, because a girl asks him to do it, doesn't seem quite convincing. Maybe, however, much may be allowed for the time and the occasion and to this must be added the entreaty which always abides in the request of a pretty woman in trouble. The gallant gentleman is captured with the papers in his possession and it looks rather squally for him, but the girl is equal to the emergency and again makes a request which is readily granted by the opposite party. Thus she is able to save the man who assisted her. The lovers, reunited, are left in their happiness, while the knight, who was considerately imprisoned in a pantry, gallops away. This picture is produced with the art which is a marked characteristic of the Edison films. Any audience will be pleased with this and managers will make no mistake in including it with their program. - The Moving Picture World, November 4, 1911",United States,J. Searle Dawley,H.B.

The scene is laid in the West and presents a French count, in immaculate attire, suddenly dropped among the cowboys. Following an altercation he offers to fight a duel, but when the results of a scheme arranged by the cowboys to show his opponent killing duelists by wholesale are seen, he breaks away and barely succeeds in catching the stage on his way back to the effete East, while the cowboys make merry over their successful joke. The character studies are excellent.

tt0001557,A Country Cupid,1911.0,4.9,124,"Romance,Short","This is not one of Griffith's better pieces. True, by this time, his control of pacing and cutting is so assured and casual that he must have been very certain of his audience. But the story is slight, and he presents an odd mixture of bucolic innocence in the outdoor scenes and contrasts it with a village idiot -- played by Joseph Graybill -- whose lust for pretty, sixteen-year-old schoolmarm Blanche Sweet drives him to a fit in which he alternately threatens her with a gun and offers himself as the gun's target.Still, Griffith's company can act for the screen by this time. Except for three or four titles at the beginning, explaining who the characters are, there is precisely one written item in the body of the movie -- the note Blanche writes her boyfriend Edwin August, which she throws away but is delivered by equally love-struck pupil, Billy, as portrayed by Edna Foster.Griffith always maintained his love for country life on the screen, but his story-telling compelled him to more complicated views of life, and his natural bent was to adorn his melodramas with some of the complexities of realities. Yes, country living is nice, but ... too bad it doesn't really work here. For completists only.",United States,D.W. Griffith,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001557/,short,1911,18

He was afraid to face his man even when he was in the right, but he was willing to persuade someone else, a brave gambler, to handle the picture's bully for the sake of the heroine and then was willing to lie to the girl in order to get her love, never realizing that she would find him out sometime. He was simply that kind of a man. The player who took the part had to meet the acting of Miss Fields, as the girl, and Mr. Anderson, as the gambler, and a very good player, as the bully. Consequently he didn't appear to very good advantage, for the other three seemed to be past excellent in their parts. Perhaps it is to the player's credit that he couldn't put the part over very effectively. There are many good things in the picture, especially for the thoughtful spectator. - The Moving Picture World, December 30, 1911",United States,Gilbert M. 'Broncho Billy' Anderson,Gilbert M.

Vainly she tries to induce her husband to take her back, but he refuses and she falls by the wayside in a dying condition, where she is found by her former lover. After she dies he hunts out her husband, forces him to go to the house and see her body and then gives him the choice of a vial of poison or bullets from is revolvers. Probably every man who sees this picture will agree that he received only his deserts.

tt0001575,The Death of Nathan Hale,1911.0,,,"Drama,Short","Another film in the historic series which is being released by this house. It tells the story of Hale much as all have read it in the books, and keeps the important dates correct. Perhaps the most striking scene is the last, where the execution suddenly resolves into the statue of Hale which stands in City Hall Park in New York. This is startling, the change from the scene of the execution to the bustle of a great city. The actor plays Washington has not quite reached the dignity of the person her represents. Gen. Putnam is well reproduced, however, and the likeness of Hale is well maintained. Altogether, however, it is a good film and deserves to be included in the series of educational subjects. - The Moving Picture World, October 14, 1911",United States,,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001575/,short,1911,
tt0001576,The Declaration of Independence,1911.0,,,"Drama,Short","How many of us as children recall the long labored effort to commit to memory that famous Declaration of Independence, and, after succeeding, immediately show our independence by forgetting it in our ""pursuit for Life, Liberty and Happiness."" What did it all mean? Nothing to us; yet we all passed through the age when history is taught us, or, as some of our more interesting neighbors would say, ""learned us."" Great is the teacher who can with some effort make us do the learning. This has been accomplished by the wonderful picture produced by the Edison Company, entitled ""The Declaration of Independence."" In this picture we are at first introduced to Mr. and Mrs. Adams' home, and a charming picture it is, showing the refinement and simplicity of the early colonial days and being, in and of itself, a wonderful study of antique furnishings, as the detail is perfect. In the home we find Mr. and Mrs. Adams and young John Quincy Adams (afterwards President of the United States), a rare young rebel who, inspired by the gossip and tales of his father and friends, would in his vigor have sent the entire British army into the Atlantic Ocean. The next scene we see young John Quincy Adams in company with his father, John Hancock, Benjamin Franklin and other prominent men, starting for the first Philadelphia Congress, and here we have a charming expression or motherly interest betrayed in the character of Mrs. John Adams, for young John in his intense feeling has concealed beneath the folds of his cape his father's sword; his mother, retaining the sword, sends her ""men folk"" out to battle, with a blessing for their safe return. Independence Hall: A great group of men, all the leadership of the day and all the hope for the future. How interesting it is to watch the long efforts of these men to avoid the war which began at Lexington. Some very excellent facial work has been accomplished in this picture and in what line of art is it more desirable and necessary? A large percentage of the understanding of a film is hinged on facial work, especially as some of the exhibitors are so careless about sub-titles. It is also most impressive to note the difference between the plain types of American architecture, severe and simple, and the rich architecture of the English castle where George III received the Colonists who submit to him the Petition, which he returns with an answer that irritates them. Attention should be centered on the exceedingly attractive picture showing the men entering Independence Hall and young John Adams waiting to ring the bell that was to be the signal of the passing of the bill. The wide spaces and the tall Doric columns give such a sense of magnitude. The grouping of the men, young Adams in the distance. Thomas Jefferson in a black velvet suit, and the stooping old figure in the foreground. The very attitude of the figures are impressing and the sense of largeness is one many of the manufacturers might copy. So the story carries us on to the ringing of the Bell of Liberty, which, by the way, I informed the manufacturers was too large, but was assured by them that it only measured one foot (a very insignificant amount) from the original. Analyzing my feelings I, too, felt the intense interest of the moment. It was a feeling of excitement that prompted the thought that a long time was required to ring the bell. But the film as a whole, here we have a mere fact, no romantic story, just plain history, and the manufacturers deserve great credit for the way they have put life and interest into so dry a document as this ""Declaration."" Even the school histories today give a condensed form. Oh! Why were we born so long ago? From a photographic standpoint and a study in expression, the details of the costumes and stage settings are perfect and a veritable study in antique decorations. All these points go to make the film so useful educationally. For of what value is it to have a story, even a historical story, developed that is so untrue in its surroundings that one is not sure if it is history or simply romance? Here is a great, dry essay, speech, call it what you will, vitalized and developed into living, breathing history, of intense interest to every American born or American adopted man or woman. Something should be said for the splendid way in which the actors and actresses have worked out their parts. I think there must be something inspiring about it to make these actors and actresses feel so keenly the spirit of the time. It is especially interesting to watch the struggle of Thomas Jefferson, as through the night he writes and plans; to see the expression of fear and doubt, interest and hope on the faces of the men who come in the early morning hour to read what he has written. The words that were to flash down into the ages and make us what we are today. The boyish impatience of young John Quincy Adams appeals to us, as also does the helpless old man as he totters up the steps and impatiently awaits the signal to sound the Liberty Bell; the wild, anxious crowd of men and women whose very backs are potent with interest as John Hancock reads to them the stirring words. Photographically, this especial scene deserves credit. It is wonderfully well posed. If all history could come to us in so happy a way, we would hot have to be ""taught."" Somebody in that studio must be afflicted with an ""artistic temperament"" and recognizes his blessing. This film will make an epoch in educational films and, if we have many more like them, students will surely find lessons their recreation. - The Moving Picture World, September 9, 1911",United States,J.

No better, sweeter thing could be devised, no more ennobling subject is possible. The doctor has summed up all the tenderness of the human heart, and has depicted it so graphically that no one can misunderstand it. The reproduction of the famous painting, ""The Doctor,"" which has been so much admired, is an excellent piece of work. The love story which runs through it is improved by the ending, which shows the girl noble enough and good enough herself to understand the motives which prompted her fiancé to leave her on the eve of their wedding and attend the poor child. The simple story, touching the heart from the beginning, is so well told that it cannot be mistaken or misunderstood, will touch the hearts of any audience in the land, and the moisture will well up in the eyes. In short, it would be difficult to conceive a picture more ennobling or purer in its influence. It represents what the photoplay is capable of doing. It will rank with one of the great picture- of the month. - The Moving Picture World, February 18, 1911",United States,J. Searle Dawley,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001585/,short,1911,15

tt0001624,For aabent Tæppe,1912.0,5.0,51,Short,"This Danish short feature has a very interesting story idea that offers all kinds of possibilities, but then it does not make use of the best of those opportunities. It ends up being at about the level of the many routine melodramas of the era, but it's still interesting for the imagination of the film-makers in trying to combine the story and themes in a different way.The setup has a husband and wife acting team preparing to play the roles of Othello and Desdemona, while in 'real life' the wife pursues an extra-marital romance. The actor playing Iago has his own advances to the wife refused, so he decides to take revenge accordingly. From there, the story follows the characters both on-stage and off-stage as events develop further, with the occasional use of props and other details to develop some of the parallels.The parallel between play and reality was an imaginative and ambitious idea for the time, and even though it does not work as well as it could have, they deserve credit for trying to make what would have been something like a more serious counterpart to the ""Kiss Me Kate"" plot. The stage sequences also preserve a brief record of the kind of costumes that the characters would have worn in a stage production at the time.In Shakespeare's plot, Desdemona is completely innocent and sympathetic, but here the audience's identification with the wife is dissipated by her deceitfulness and coldness. Likewise, in Shakespeare, you can admire Iago's evil brilliance even as you are repulsed by the character, but here he's just a mean-spirited tattle-tale. So, unfortunately, the way it is set up limits or prevents much of the tension and suspense that could have been developed. In the end, it's more interesting for what it could have been, rather than for what it is.",Denmark,August Blom,Louis Möller,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001624/,short,1912,23
tt0001625,The Forester's Plea,1911.0,,,"Short,Western","A virile and interesting idea is presented in this picture, although the writer of the scenario deserves only the Homeric credit of knowing a good thing when seen. Mr. Norman Duncan's story of the Rev. Fairweather and his lumberjack friends, printed about a year ago in Harper's, is followed very closely indeed by this picture. That is, not at all in derogation; one is a story, the other a moving picture. Sometimes producers forget that there is any difference in form between the two and spoil a picture to make it too closely like some good short story. This is a good picture and worth seeing, although the virile idea it tried to bring out, and that the story brought out very clearly, is only suggested faintly. - The Moving Picture World, November 18, 1911",United States,Gilbert M.

When you're instructed, you may not remember as well as when you work it out yourself, and the stark situations in this short film make their points clearly.I've been looking at a bunch of Broncho Billy Anderson shorts recently restored by the BFI and made available on DVD.

tt0001634,From the Bottom of the Sea,1911.0,,,"Drama,Short","This is the first two-reel Imp release. Briefly, it may be summed up as a sugar-coated educational picture dealing as it does principally with the operation and maneuvering of a United States submarine war vessel. Perhaps the principal difficulty of making a picture of this kind is the obtaining of permission from the government officials to allow a moving picture company such unlimited use of one of their vessels. In ""From the Bottom of the Sea"" we have one of the most interesting nautical pictures that has been produced in many a day and millions of people will marvel when it is finally released. There has been woven around these naval maneuvers a story of heart interest that will keep it from being a dry educational picture to those who prefer human interest in the pictures. The story is a simple one, dealing with the love of a young ensign for the daughter of a United States Naval Lieutenant. The young man's love is reciprocated, but her father withholds his consent, for the reason that the young man has not yet made his mark. Hovering about is an attaché of the Diplomatic Corps of a foreign power. He is a much older man than the young ensign and far more able to undertake the responsibilities of matrimony. But the lieutenant's daughter has made her choice and the lucky man is the ensign. News comes that the ensign has been detailed to command a submarine torpedo boat. The lovers are pleased with this news, for they hope that soon this first commission will give the ensign an opportunity to prove his worth. He pays a visit to the submarine lying at the wharf accompanied by the unscrupulous diplomat, whom he does not suspect of any evil design. While in the hull of the deep sea vessel the foreign attaché manages to steal the ballast tank blow valve, which is a part of the compressed air apparatus used in sinking and raising the vessel. Carefully concealing this beneath his coat the attaché leaves the vessel in company with the ensign. The ensign returns later with the father of his sweetheart who is to go with the young suitor on the first trial spin and instruct him in the ways of handling the craft. From this point forward the film becomes extremely interesting because of the maneuvers of the submarine boat. We see the perfect handling of this remarkable craft as it rises and dips beneath the waves, completely submerging itself and rising again with an exactness and certainty that leaves little doubt in the mind of any beholder as to the practicability of the modern submarine. Following the thread of the story, there is trouble below with the vessel when an attempt is made to rise. The men are shown undergoing the physical and mental hardships incident to such a perilous predicament, all of which is done in a remarkably realistic way. The acting, of course, is good, but what helps it immensely is the remarkable interior setting of the submarine vessel, which is pictured herewith. This interior setting deserves more than passing notice. The producers exerted every effort to make it an exact counterpart of the interior of the U.S.S. ""Octopus,"" a submarine vessel stationed at Newport, R.I., where the picture was taken. A photograph was taken of the interior of the ""Octopus,"" measurements were carefully taken down and the scene was made with these as a pattern. Several days of painstaking work resulted in this stage setting, which cannot be commended too highly. So careful were the Imp people in arranging this scene that all the machinery represented was genuine and practical mechanism. Steamfitters were employed to cut and join the pipes, the valves and gauges and other mechanical parts. The scene in itself is a lesson on the interior construction of a submarine boat. We get an idea of the working of the periscope, which is an instrument that enables the sailors to see what is going on above the water line, while they themselves are 18 feet below. We see the water-depth gauge and the workings of compressed air apparatus in discharging torpedoes, rising and lowering the craft, etc., etc. The point in the story is reached where the sailors are beginning to feel the terrible effects of their imprisonment. One of them goes out of his mind and unless something is done by some volunteer all hands will perish. This is the opportunity for the young ensign to make his name, and he is not long in realizing it. As the inspiration comes to him he volunteers to make his exit through the torpedo tube and go for help above. It is a desperate chance, but the only one. Into the torpedo tube he goes fearlessly. The heavy breech is closed and locked and he is propelled far out into the water by the great force of compressed air and is shot above the waves as by a catapult. He quickly reaches the parent ship which usually accompanies submarines on trial trips. This boat is equipped with a complete diving apparatus and other paraphernalia for the quick assistance of disabled submarines. It is not generally known, perhaps, that modern submarines are tapped on the side for a fresh air supply. A diver descends from the boat with an air tube, which he screws into a tap on the side of the submarine, and at once a fresh supply of air is pumped to the men within. By these heroic means did the young ensign rescue the vessel and all those on board, including the father of the girl he loved. The villainous naval attaché is confronted by the young ensign and accused of his murderous act which, no doubt, is the end of his official usefulness. After this the two lovers are gratefully united by the lieutenant and the young ensign honored and applauded by the seamen. - The Moving Picture World, November 4, 1911",United States,,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001634/,short,1911,10

The child is his daughter and consoles him when he lost the woman who had engaged herself to him. A younger man won her away from him. This man was hurt a little later. The doctor knows that he could have killed him, but cured him nevertheless. His latter theme has been used several times and it isn't pleasing in itself. A new player takes the part of the young woman. She is, herself, pleasing, but does not have a great faculty for the expression that makes a picture effective. Perhaps she has come from the stage where the voice is depended upon and experience will teach her the difference, for she shows intelligence.

She easily passes the guard and, mounting a horse, gallops wildly across the desert for aid. She meets a regiment of Scotch Highlanders.

The attempt was not successful. As a picture of character drawing, it is worthy of the highest praise. In fact, such films as this keep motion pictures as a whole on a high artistic plane, in spite of the amount of trash that is shown. The two men were Western miners, bunkies, and lived in the same cabin. Both were dreaming of the same woman, the girl back East. She wrote saying that she was in need and asking that one come to help her, promising her love to the one who came. This criticizes the girl harshly, but the scenario writer didn't take time to be interested in her. The two men toss a coin to see who will go. The one who loses takes his hat and goes out. It would have been better to have made the result of the toss plainer. The one who wins, after thinking, decides to let the other go, and writes telling him so. He then prepares to leave the country. On his way out, the other man shoots, wounding him. He finds the letter later, and realizes. It's a good, dramatic picture. - The Moving Picture World, November 25, 1911",United States,Gilbert M.

Indeed, there was loud applause in one theater.

The girl, daughter of a not very wise old sheriff, is loved by a cow puncher of good character. Her father wants her to marry a man whom he trusts, but whom she despises. This character shows the gold lust. He then conspires with another evil character to rob a bank. He so arranges things that he is with the sheriff while the robbery is being done. He and the sheriff chase this robber and he kills him. They are in a lonely place and, after the other is dead, he kills the sheriff for the sake of the gold. He then attempts to abduct the girl. The hero, meanwhile, in a very conventional way, has fastened to him the suspicion that it was he who killed the sheriff. The villain makes a false step, however, and the boys understand the situation. It seems like a quickly thrown-together picture.

For a well-known heiress to give out fake information that her beauty or fortune has disappeared is common in stories. But to make it doubly strong and say that both good looks and money are gone is working it pretty hard. However, the poor man of the three suitors, the only one of them who might have been expected to want gold, responds nobly and gets the woman, her good looks unspoiled and her bankroll intact. Such stories are not dramatic. But there is a human touch about them that is always interesting and an audience will watch such a picture and possibly applaud it, when one with strong dramatic situations will be received in silence. - The Moving Picture World, April 22, 1911",United States,Phillips Smalley,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001656/,short,1911,

It's a good comedy. - The Moving Picture World, October 14, 1911",United States,Van Dyke Brooke,Van Dyke Brooke,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001662/,short,1911,10

tt0001664,Her Two Sons,1911.0,,,"Drama,Romance,Short","The mother was blind, one of her sons was a clergyman and the other, a younger man, was impulsive and not yet grown into his character. Both love the same girl, a neighbor, and the younger man elopes with her and then deserts her. This is a dignified situation, one that handled by a skillful novelist or dramatist would make a great book or drama. One feels that the picture (effective as it is) doesn't really get hold of the core of it. The situation is pictured fairly clearly, but something of the resultant emotion is lost due to its not being absolutely clear. However, as much as we get of it, we are thankful for, and it makes an acceptable picture. The clergyman is played by Arthur Johnson, the girl by Florence Lawrence, and the younger brother by Albert McGovern. The scene where the younger brother abandons his wife is pictured by both well. The scene where the younger brother tells the clergyman that he has tired of his wife and left her is made significant by Johnson. A small boy has an important part in the scenes of the reconciliation after the wife has come back to the village with her baby. It would have been better if this boy had been given a place in the picture before he was actually needed, his presence would have been taken more as a matter of course. - The Moving Picture World, August 26, 1911",United States,Harry Solter,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001664/,short,1911,
tt0001665,Her Wedding Ring,1911.0,,,"Drama,Romance,Short","Perhaps the villain pictured on this film is a shade meaner than other villains, he is such a pup anyway that he transcends conventionality. He forced Lulu to marry him by an action that was smaller than the littlest potatoes and then hardly drew a sober breath. The man from the East fell in love with her before he saw her wedding ring, but she refused to elope with him. Her husband overheard the conversation and it shamed him into becoming a man. It is an interesting picture, but the story is not typical nor even convincing enough to be vital. The photography of some of the scenes is very good. The backgrounds are not wholly in keeping, but, the miner's cabin is truly made of logs. It is luxuriously furnished. - The Moving Picture World, October 28, 1911",United States,Bannister Merwin,Bannister Merwin,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001665/,short,1911,

Two Indians visit his cabin three times and force his wife to give them food. The third time the little girl runs and tells her father. He returns and has them chastised with a whip. That night he is decoyed from the cabin and the Indians set fire to it. The woman and her daughter with difficulty escape with their lives. When the miner returns he finds them shivering in their night clothes beside the ruins of their shanty. He begins poking about among the ruins, seeking bits of metal which have not been destroyed by the fire, and turns up a nugget of gold. - The Moving Picture World, July 8, 1911",United States,Gilbert M.

There's a delightful little touch of poetry given to the picture at the very beginning. It is the message that the Old Woman of Bambury Cross brings to the poor little nurse girl. She is tired and weary, and the old woman tells her that Old King Cole has commissioned her to choose her as the bride for the prince. Could anything be better? It is just the human touch needed to grip our interest in the story. The projection, when it was seen, wasn't very good and the reviewer doesn't dare comment on the photography. Some of the scenes were very pretty, while others might perhaps have been improved by more careful rehearsing. The cow was a dummy and spoiled one scene, though a well-made dummy might have been better than a real cow. On the whole, the picture is delightful and very commendable. It is likely to please the majority of spectators very much indeed. - The Moving Picture World, September 23, 1911",United States,Thomas H. Ince,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001686/,short,1911,

He dresses up as a servant and brings in the tray of wine to the British officers and cleverly manages to get the map that they have made. They suspect him and he has to fight his way out.

It presents vivid pictures of the Spanish grandee life, just passing away, and the unscrupulous land-grabbers who in many instances succeeded in securing valuable estates because the Spanish owners would not register their properties as required by law. The main interest in this picture lies in its truth. There is no love story, and when the American agent shoots the land grabber to prevent him committing intentional murder the audience is ready to applaud.

tt0001697,In the Days of Chivalry,1911.0,,,"Drama,Romance,Short","A story of love and lovers taken from the quaint verses which tell of Accausin and Nicolette. Probably not many who will see the film have read the verses, but the picture has the merit of being interesting without a knowledge of the poem. It is one of those love tales in which first the father of the young man, a duke, objects to his son's marriage and imprisons the girl. She escapes, and the young man searches for her, exacting a promise from his father that he may wed the girl of his choice if he wins the next battle. He wins, but the father still objects, and the young man runs away during his betrothal. The girl, a princess in her own right, now encounters her share of difficulty, her father having ideas about her marriage which do not coincide with hers. She runs away, disguised as a harper, making her way back to find her lover, now the reigning duke in place of his father. They are married and the love tale ends in consummation. The setting is very elaborate, and the pageant of dukes and earls, and knights and ladles, which move across the screen are all interesting, appealing strongly to the imagination and presenting a picture difficult to surpass in its beauty and completeness Many of the scenes are artistically conceived and carried out, and the entire picture will attract attention because it is above the ordinary, possessing qualities which refute the main criticisms of motion pictures and and their weakness. It will take rank among the best films of the month. - The Moving Picture World, January 14, 1911",United States,J. Searle Dawley,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001697/,short,1911,

To waste all the good material required to represent a barber, as inconstant to a girl, and she equally as inconstant, is expensive amusement. The story is puerile. The actors, having no opportunity, do nothing, and the audience wearily awaits the finish. Such pictures as this, with Biograph trade-mark, cannot fail to shock those who have looked for the best of all American films from this company. With their old capable actors scattered, and weak plays, acted by poor substitutes for their former excellent company, the Biograph pictures no longer attract the attention they once did. - The Moving Picture World, January 21, 1911",United States,D.W.

tt0001710,Italian Blood,1911.0,,,"Drama,Short","One doesn't need to be told that the workman's wife in this picture is Italian, or at least of Southern blood; nor that her husband is Irish, that is, not while he remembers that he is Irish. The man loves her, but because he doesn't show it as an Italian would, she feels that he is cold. An Irishman likes to light his own pipe, while an Italian likes to have his wife hold the match. The wife tries to waken her husband's love through jealousy, and very nearly brings about a tragedy. The man overhears a conversation just in time and understands. The picture gets a pretty firm grip on a very human situation, and is fairly well designed. It is a picture worthwhile seeing. If the acting is not equally careful in all the scenes, in the best scenes it is fine. - The Moving Picture World, October 21, 1911",United States,D.W. Griffith,Bernardine R.

The graphic way in which this is represented here made a deep impression upon an audience, even in New York, where the thing is so common that a considerable proportion of the population wink at it as a necessity, and let it pass. The happy ending for the poor girl, following the denunciation of his father by the young man, is dramatic, but, unfortunately, few instances of this sort actually occur.

The little one's loyalty in securing his pipe and tobacco after the step-mother had thrown it out the window is a tender bit of acting. Then comes the cruel banishment to the attic, and the little one's using her hoard of pennies to buy more tobacco, only to find that her grandpa was dead. The last scene, where she is placing flowers on his grave will arouse the emotions very strongly so pathetic and natural is it.

tt0001742,Lost Illusions,1911.0,6.2,16,"Romance,Short","The review that appears here is of a film preserved in the EYE institute under this title. It was wrongly identified as Lost Illusions but has since been correctly identified as The Price (1911).Lost Illusions was a film about an unmarried country girl who falls in love with a visiting young artist. She subsequently marries a countryman but persuades her husband to take her to town so that she can seek out the man she still loves. He however is married and rejects her and so at first does her husband, when she returns to him, although they are eventually reconciled.The EYE film concerns a young married couple in the country, who have a young child. The wife is seduced by a city-man and goes off to become his mistress, abandoning husband and child. She at first enjoys considerable social success but her lover tires of her and she endured the usual fate of the fallen woman (poverty and sickness). In the meantime, back in the country, her child has died but the husband remains heart-broken. When the doctor lets him know of his wife's approaching death, he rushes to town but only arrives in time to witness her decease.",United States,Edwin S. Porter,Edwin S.

tt0001751,Love and Hatred,1911.0,,,"Drama,Short,Western","Roy Norton's ""The Greater Hate,"" furnished the scenario for this picture. It would have been better if it had furnished only the situation. It seems that more than half of the film was used up in stating the situation. Much of this preliminary work was of use in the story as giving what is called ""local color."" The incident of the teacher's birthday presents was useful chiefly for that purpose, but added very little to the development of the action. It sometimes takes pages to give local color to a story; a picture is full of it the instant it is thrown on the screen. Consequently, it is a waste of time for a picture producer to linger on such scenes. He should grasp only the kernel of the story, its central situation and picture that in action, if he wants to be powerful. None of the players gave any special significance to these early scenes. Later, when the woman's true lover and her faithful husband meet, there is a dramatic and powerfully-acted scene. The heroine looked pretty, but the picture was not a very fortunate choice as a vehicle for her expression. She has done better work in romantic comedies. - The Moving Picture World, November 18, 1911",United States,,Roy Norton,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001751/,short,1911,

tt0001753,Love in the Hills,1911.0,6.0,19,"Drama,Short","The characters in this picture are the same in type as those in a recent release of the Biograph Company, ""The Revenue Man and the Girl."" The backgrounds and scenes also are similar. The players who act the picture are different. On the whole, it is not so successful, being, by its very nature, more suitable for the story teller than the picture maker. This is most noticeable where one of the picture's characters plays on the violin and the effect of his music is shown in the heroine's charge of attitude toward a city man who is visiting the hills. She didn't love him, but under the music's spell, she thought she did. We don't hear any music when the shiftless genius of the hills scrapes on his old fiddle. We suspect that it's pretty dismal sound, but in the next scene we see the girl listening and then we see her fall into the arms of the city man. It doesn't seem very effecting. The two plan to run away together and this speedily brings the story to its climax, the discrediting of the city fop and the girl's recognition of the worthy qualities is a sturdy young mountaineer, whom, without knowing it, she had really loved from the first even while she had repulsed and made fun of him. This, the player's work had shown rather skillfully. The manly mountaineer's part is also very well done as is, in fact, each of the parts. The picture has a good deal of humor, for the fiddler too loved the girl and he thought to win her with pumpkins. That is a very commendable addition, quite true of rural life. The picture will stand, because of the good things that are in it. - The Moving Picture World, November 4, 1911",United States,D.W.

The early scenes, especially the one drawn after Hovenden's ""Breaking Home Ties,"" could hardly be improved upon. The youth felt the lure of the city and determined to win his fortune. The working up to the scene where he takes leave of his mother was like life itself. It was acted and posed with truly wonderful skill, but, at the close, when the scene became like the picture, it was held quiet, frozen, for an instant. This touch of self-consciousness was a mistake and it alone robbed the scene of perfection. The youth reaches the city, is disillusioned; but is, at length brought back to the farm by his sweetheart who goes to the city after him. One of the picture's strongest points is the types which, except those at the city boarding house, give a very realistic atmosphere to the story. - The Moving Picture World, December 9, 1911",United States,Ashley Miller,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001760/,short,1911,

The man to whom the mother is engaged falls in love with the daughter without knowing this relationship. Almost the same thing was shown in a film released a day or two before. Another coincidence was that it was released by the company that is most like the Biograph.

In the early scenes, the man is shown as merely a barnstormer. The hard experience of the girl who fell in love with him, ran away and married him and was soon separated from him but, in abject poverty, found him in the end, grips our sympathies. The story is very well managed and at least two of the scenes are filled with significance. The silent picture can sometimes go where words cannot follow. The two great scenes are when the father brings the girl home after she has married the actor, and again when she finds her father dead in his chair. It is extremely well acted in most of its scenes.

When next we see him, he is among criminals to whom the dishonest servant of a planter comes ostensibly seeking a doctor, but really to tell them of a large sum of money at the planter's. The chief of the robbers compels the outcast to impersonate the doctor and get the cash with the dishonest servant's help. He consents after being threatened; but the farmer's daughter trusts him with the keys to the safe and, later, when the gang arrives, he helps the farmer's wife and daughter stand off the robbers until the farmer returns with a real doctor and they are driven off.

The question will rise in one's mind regarding the advisability of the young man leaving his sweetheart and taking a wife in the wilderness, but having done it he closed the incident in the right way by sticking to her.

tt0001775,Maud Muller,1912.0,,,"Drama,Short,Western","A two-reel picture illustrating Whittier's poem and produced by Thomas Recketts. Well-chosen quotations from the poem are used as leaders and not only explain the story but add poetry to it. In fact, the pictures and the quotations are much more poetic than the quotations alone, or the poem itself, for its chief charm comes from the story and not from its treatment. Miss Vivian Rich makes a charming Maud. Not only is she young and pretty, but by her acting she delightfully interprets her part. Donald MacDonald plays the judge with very commendable dignity. Indeed, from first to last, it is a finely acted. worthy production and presents the story quite naturally and convincingly just as it might have happened in the South. Such a story as this is not bound to Massachusetts, not by any means. Every scene seems to have been chosen with care and a true feeling for what is significant and natural; yet not one scene belongs to New England. In the general construction of the picture and in its division into scenes, the producer has been extremely happy. The first part opens with the first meeting of the judge with Maud in the hay-field and carries us to Maud's half- willing betrothal to the young farmer. The second reel opens with the second meeting of the judge and Maud over the hay cocks. The two marriages follow quickly with the two poetic dreams of what ""might have been,"" that come in later years. It makes a very good production; one that will bear high praise and one that can hardly be too strongly commended to exhibitors. If the story is a bit sentimental, it gets over. The charm of this picture centers especially in its Maud. - The Moving Picture World, September 21, 1912",United States,Tom Ricketts,Ulric Blair Collins,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001775/,short,1912,

The early scenes, both as to the sets and the business, were so like a recent Bison picture that opens with the same situation, a drunken Chinese cook, that the reviewer was under the impression that he had already seen the picture. After the foreman started out to find a new cook, the situation took a new turn. A pretty young woman (Miss Grandin, a new Bison surprise, plays the part) after a quarrel with her husband is shown looking for a job in an intelligence office. The foreman engages her and takes her to the ranch. The boys get a glimpse of her and all rush to tidy up. She is embarrassed, and decidedly over-seasons the stew, about a pound of pepper went into it. One of her admirers makes the outfit eat their grub at the pistol's point, whether they like it or not. They then hurry out to Dr. Green's. The boss had to eat his grub with the others. He wanted to fire the new cook, but the boys wouldn't have it. Meanwhile, the girl's husband has learned her whereabouts and arrives at the ranch after supper, when the whole crowd is out singing. When she runs to her husband's arms, there's a sorry looking bunch of punchers. At the end they sing ""No Wedding Bells."" It's a good comedy, but Bison has done better. - The Moving Picture World, December 23, 1911",United States,Thomas H. Ince,Thomas H. Ince,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001807/,short,1911,10

Upon her return she meets the young man and they fall in love at first sight. But her father speedily puts a stop to that when he tells her that this was the young man who discharged him. The next turn in fortune's wheel shows the young man bankrupt and at the sheriff's sale the old manager buys the factory and everything else.

He returns secretly and very romantically meets a young woman who betrays him and assists in his capture, but relents and elopes with him afterward. A situation like this is sufficient to arouse the emotions and hold them. The meeting, when the young man acts as a highwayman to obtain the wherewithal to assist his unfortunate friend who helped him, their subsequent meeting at a masked ball, and the girl's betrayal all afford ample opportunity for thrilling action. The players do very well indeed. Then comes the girl's remorse as love awakens. They escape together and are married when they reach the coast and fly to France where they live happily afterward. A story of this character is more than ordinarily interesting and will please an audience better than almost anything a manager can offer. - The Moving Picture World, January 27, 1912",United States,Sidney Olcott,Dion Boucicault,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001811/,short,1912,

The terrible sufferings of the desert are too much for the man and he succumbs before he can be aided. The ending is commended. It never seems quite right for a sheriff to break the laws by allowing an outlaw to escape, as has been represented in some cases, merely because he performed some service for which the official might have felt indebted to him. This ending is more satisfactory. The sheriff is left under no obligation and the outlaw is removed from society which he menaces. - The Moving Picture World, March 11, 1911",United States,Gilbert M.

tt0001834,The Politician's Dream,1911.0,,,"Comedy,Short","A notable film and a notable comedy is this hilarious undertaking. It is seldom we look at a comedy that involves a cast of 800 people. Of course, it is true that some of the cast were unconsciously working for the Vitagraph; they form the innocent bystanders in the large political parade that is part of this picture. The entire Vitagraph corps was in action here, not only the regular actors, but all the mechanics, scene painters, property men, wardrobe people, cooks, waiters, watchmen and all, form a part of the great parade that marches in endorsement of Simon Stubbs (John Bunny) for Mayor of New York. There were several hundred extra people engaged for the procession, numerous carriages and a fife and drum corps to lead it. This street parade is one of the best pieces of production work that it has been our pleasure to witness. Simon Stubbs was a country politician who had his own theories concerning civic government. He disagreed with everybody on matters of state, with the exception of a certain widow lady with whom he a.greed on any topic for reasons that lodged around his heart more than they did in his head. The work of Mr. Bunny in this production is perfection. Nobody could ask or expect anything better from that sterling comedian, or anyone else. He is rapidly becoming the most famous comedian the world has ever known, and if the Vitagraph people continue to provide him with vehicles of this sort his fame will know no bounds. ""The Politician's Dream"" is a very simple story. It is based upon a mere thread; that of a country politician who falls asleep and dreams that he is sent for to come to the Metropolis from a little country town and become Mayor of New York. It would take some such man as Charles Dickens to properly describe the personality of Mr. Bunny and it is needless to describe it to those who are familiar with his work in moving pictures. But in ""The Politician's Dream"" he is seen at his best in the role of a country politician, taking himself seriously and being taken seriously by others. According to the dream, a committee from New York calls upon Simon at his simple country domicile and there tender to him marks of appreciation of his great perspicacity and political acumen. Having delivered these sentiments they then deliver a set of resolutions inviting him to come to New York City and accept the office of Mayor. Simon responds in a becoming manner and makes his departure from the village in true presidential style. In the city he is acclaimed on all sides and becomes the man of the hour. The way in which Simon deports himself, and the dignity with which he endeavors to carry his new- found honor, is an exquisite bit of pantomime that will stand the test of time. The great parade is held in his honor and Simon is elected mayor by the most overwhelming majority ever known. But meanwhile, back in his country home, a venomous serpent has crept into his garden of bliss. His hated rival, Mr. Binks (W'm. Shea), has made great inroads into the affections of the Widow Merritt (Miss Flora Finch). To what purpose then are empty honors? What profiteth a man though he he elected Mayor of New York if he lose his own soulmate? Learning the sad news. Simon puts glory behind him and hastens back to the village to intercept the approaching wedding. Arriving there, he finds himself too late and is thumped brutally upon his voluptuous nose by the destroyer of his bliss. This thump upon his well-upholstered proboscis b.rings about the awakening of Simon Stubbs and in his awakening he perceives the futility of empty honors as compared with the joy of having for a helpmate such a woman as the Widow Merritt. A simple plot but strongly done and all the stronger for its simplicity. - The Moving Picture World, November 25, 1911",United States,George D.

The outlaw's actions in the cabin of the woman and her daughter, where, at the point of a pistol, he forces them to give him food and also to send the sheriff's posse on the wrong track, is more commendable for its art than for its ethical value. The next day the outlaw, now wounded, stumbles, fainting, into the cabin of a minister. The minister's daughter bathes his face, and when he is recovering reads to him from the Bible. That he falls in love with her and repents is shown with a good measure of effect. He serves his time.

tt0001853,The Reform Candidate,1911.0,,,"Drama,Short","This play deals with a live issue of interest and importance to Americans of all classes. It lifts the curtain of official secrecy from practices that are going on at this very minute; it is instructive without being tiresome, and it points out with incidental irony the kind of ""public service"" we are getting from business organizations and the men we elect to office to be their tools. All this is done in entertaining story form, with a dramatic struggle between two opposed forces and a delightful love interest centered upon a girl who has to fight her way instead of having it prepared for her; the kind of up-to-date heroine that American audiences admire more than the clinging vine variety. The pivotal character is not the one indicated in the title role, though the honors are his in the end, but is that of a girl reporting for a daily paper attired as are the better class of business and professional women in our daily lives, who conducts herself with a combination of modesty, high spirit and intelligence that is thoroughly representative of a type that we all recognize. In this matter of types the entire photoplay is exceptionally good. Especially effective is the man who plays the role of the financier of corrupt practices. Instead of an actor in white spats, we have a gentleman at ease in a dress suit, who looks as though he really had an asset of costly experiences in high living behind his impersonate n. He looks like one of those men of immense wealth who have grown so indifferent to public opinion that they over-reach themselves in an excess- of greed. He seeks to influence the reform candidate through his daughter and unwittingly furnishes the material for his own downfall to the keen-witted girl reporter. Her adventures are perilous enough to thrill, and the outcome of her splendid scoop is one that will win the approval of every right-minded man and woman in the audience.

The girl is the daughter of a settler passing through the country in a prairie schooner. The danger comes from Indians and the rescuers are cowboys, led by the hero, who has fallen in love with the girl. The picture's quality comes from well-photographed, desert scenes and Rio Grande scenes, and also from good riding and a well-managed accident to the prairie schooner.

tt0001867,The Ruling Passion,1911.0,,,"Drama,Short","This Biograph film deserves special notice because of its juvenile characters. The play is unique because of the fact that children take the most important parts from beginning to end, and their histrionic ability is deserving of commendation. A bright boy having been to the theater is controlled by a passion for acting, and at a children's party produces some very creditable little plays. Going from the house to the seashore, the acting is made more real upon the water when, through the loosening of a rope, two young people are carried away in a boat upon an ebb tide. It is some time before the youthful stage manager can procure assistance in the timely arrival of his parents, who secure the aid of a motor boat to pursue the little craft, which is rapidly foundering. The thrilling chase of the motor boat is somewhat prolonged, causing the danger of the children to become very harrowing to the feelings of the beholders. The rescue is, however, timely, and a restored family made happy; a little punishment is administered to the cause of the mishap, and the youngsters are all put to bed with the parents' happy ""good night,"" but still in his dreams the young actor continues to give evidences of the ""ruling passion."" There are some pretty pictures in this film, and altogether it is one to interest the family, children will like it, and parents will see that it carries the lessons of timely warning. It encourages the development of the good in the boy and rebukes the bad, and will prove helpful in suggesting the control of a ""ruling passion."" - The Moving Picture World, September 9, 1911",United States,D.W.

Some interest will attach to the smoking out of the school by the youngsters who pour sulfur down the chimney and cover the top with a sack. This sort of deviltry was common enough some years ago, but, like many other coarse and crude attempts at fun, this has disappeared. As a bit of history, however, it is interesting, and represents what teachers were formerly subjected to in numerous instances.

Perhaps one of the most satisfactory scenes in a long time is the pommeling he gets when her husband returns and sees what the wretch is doing. It is rough work, but it is salutary and will be applauded by a considerable proportion of those who see it. The characters all perform their parts acceptably and there is a swing and dash to the story which makes it attractive, despite its suggestiveness and rough vigor.

The photography is somewhat below the standard of this company in one or two of the scenes, especially in one showing four tepees, it is very poor. But the story is very interesting and also instructive. Its atmosphere is very religious; there's an effective picture of a conversion and one of an Alaskan funeral in it. One very small fault is noticeable. The sky pilot falls overcome and is snowed under, is found by Indians, rescued and taken to the tepees, but he nevertheless comes out of the tepee a day or so later with a fresh white collar and cuffs. - The Moving Picture World, August 12, 1911",United States,,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001888/,short,1911,

The film is a transcript of life as it often is. There are such episodes in some lives and some hearts will respond as the heart of this gypsy girl responded to the man's helplessness.

It merely furnishes us with a dream of fame and fortune better than we could spin for ourselves. Then there's the dream-fancy picture or novel. It is much harder to think up, but it is much more satisfying and delightful. The dream-fancy is never more fascinating than when it takes us back of the time curtain, as that popular drama, ""On the Road to Yesterday,"" did. It is certainly a treat to be carried backward or forward or any way at all out of time convincingly. That is what this picture does. It is a dream-fancy told to a party in a motor boat passing Indian Ledge. We see the ledge approaching and then the story is told of the Indian who, centuries before, was put to sleep by a manic drug and left in a tiny care, to be pulled out and revived by some tourists. He has a very exciting time till he is scared to a stone image by a big steamboat that comes on him unexpectedly. Then, the story being ended, the ledge is shown again nearby, and we see the stone Indian marked on the cliff. Mark McDcrmott plays the Indian very well indeed.

So far as the picture dealing with the labor question is concerned, it only shows some scenes in a strike. The heroic action of the woman in rising from a sick bed and riding for aid rouses the sympathy of the audience, while the steadfast determination of Logan to stand by the company is commendable. That he succeeds in securing the consent of the superintendent to increase wages is quite as much to his credit as the superintendent's.

The audience laughed with whole-souled volume and the reviewer is still laughing. A young and romantic Miss in love learns that her father's farm is mortgaged. She falls asleep and then the melodramas, from ""The Two Orphans"" down, begin. She has her part in every scene, is the heroine, loved by the hero, a country boy friend of hers, and pursued by the villain and villainess, people she knew. And how it is acted! Mary Fuller takes the part. One of the managers of the theater came to where the reviewer sat and complimented the picture and this player's work especially. Wm. West is the farmer. The man who holds the mortgage, in the dream, the villain, is James Gordon. His daughter, in the dream the villainess, is Laura Sawyer, and the country boy, hero in the dream, is Yale Benner. It is a very commendable picture; but to appreciate it, one needs to have seen melodramas or moving pictures of melodramas. - The Moving Picture World, January 6, 1912",United States,J.

But between Little Miss Prue, the stenographer to whom Mrs. Nag objects and the prim Miss Prus, of next day, the supposedly new stenographer, there is such an amusing difference that it alone is worthwhile seeing. These character plays of the Vitagraph Company are all good. This is better than the average, but they are not to be compared with the real comedies that this company produces every now and then. - The Moving Picture World, July 29, 1911",United States,George D.

This clownish maid was not played with convincing effect. The young lady who took the part seemed unusually competent, but she was poorly cast. Her looks belied her at every minute nearly, in spite of clever facial expression, and then one can't keep up clownish work all the time, especially if one was born with the face of an artist. The poor servant girl too greatly admired the pretty sash of the spoiled child and after she had put her to bed, borrowed it to sec how it would look on herself, took it to her room. But the spoiled girl found it out and brought her mamma to search for it. The sunshine came through the love of the stable boy who consoled the girl for her harsh treatment by the spoiled child.

Mary Pickford, of course, helps a lot in gaining the viewer's sympathy.  The title of ""Sweet Memories"" is quite appropriate for this nice little film, which in a seemingly effortless way draws you into the lives of its characters and makes you care about them.

tt0001912,The Switchman's Tower,1911.0,,,"Drama,Short","It is a living photograph that opens this strong and wholly praiseworthy picture of a noble, human act. Indeed, what the switchman did was as fine a deed of heroism as was ever done. Such a picture as this is a rebuke to much that is thrown upon the screen. Is it the photoplay's first business to show us that men and women can be base, criminal, fugitives from justice or that men can be human and are so, once in a while? One wonders whether the people really prefer a picture like this or one that is well entitled, ""The Fugitive's Second Crime."" ""The Switchman's Tower"" is no sentimental picture, nor is it a picture of angels, it is full of human truth. It's a picture of railroad life, and much more interesting than the man chase pictures. The characters are all clear cut and realistic. Herbert Prior, one of the most competent photoplayers in the business, is the switchman; Mary Fuller plays his wife and the engineer is James Gordon. The switchman's little girl (Edna May Weick) also deserves praise. The acting of all, including the fireman, is perfect and the settings could hardly be improved. The camera man always has just enough of the engine or train or whatever to make a perfect background and he manages to catch the very life of every scene, except, to be painfully exact, just one; it fills only a foot or two of the reel, when the switchman is looking out of the tower while his wife is talking with the engineer. - The Moving Picture World, August 19, 1911",United States,,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001912/,short,1911,

Even though my pleasure in this work is peculiarly academic -- I am more interested in finding hints of what Dwan will become rather than the movie at hand -- fans of early movies of Mr. Dwan should find it a pleasant fifteen minutes.",United States,Allan Dwan,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001925/,short,1911,10

A girl is kidnapped, and trussed up to a tree in front of her lover's cabin, while the kidnapper goes in and finds the lover with the intention of murdering him. In this he is thwarted and is afterward shot dead by the girl's lover. This is all sensational enough, but is saved from the usual disagreeable coarseness by the excellent acting. Usually such films are more or less disagreeable, but in this instance the acting is its saving grace and the audience plainly expresses its approval. - The Moving Picture World, April 8, 1911",United States,Gilbert M.

The tomboy was charming in her riding habit and she, with her little sister and their guardian, made a very pretty picture out riding in Bronx Park. But she did not shine in society and her accidents and the reproofs she got made her so ashamed that she ran away and joined a Wild West show. Her guardian sought her for months without finding her; but the show came to the town where the family was spending the summer and the little sister finds her. There are some pretty horses and pretty riding in the picture which makes a very pleasing, wholesome character story.

The officer who is most in love with her and most in despair proposes to the other officer that they cut a pack of cards to see who shall withdraw. Such an incident is not very likely to effect the average spectator powerfully. We may sympathize with a man who gambles away his money, but we are not so likely to feel for a man who will gamble away his chance of winning a girl. The most popular romantic heroes fight their battle in the way the vast majority of American spectators approve of. However, this incident was utilized to lead up to a very charming picture in which the girl, having found her own preference, is making love prettily to a man who in honor can't respond to it, though his heart is nearly breaking. This scene is worthwhile most certainly. The picture is well acted and acceptable. - The Moving Picture World, September 2, 1911",United States,,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001947/,short,1911,

tt0001954,Uncle Hiram's List,1911.0,,,"Comedy,Short","A story of a country town and chiefly of two real characters who lived there. Uncle Hiram, the village censor, kept a ""skunk list,"" and it kept him busy recording the failings of his fellow townsfolk. Uncle Hiram's strength lay in the fact that whatever name went down on the list, all except the name's owner could see the righteousness of having it there. But Uncle Hiram wasn't always a good judge. He got Jimmie's name down there for cowardice. Jimmie was sensitive and he made good as a brave youngster to prove himself no coward. It is gently pathetic how Uncle Hiram came to Jimmie's bedside and changed the position of his name to a place amongst the heroes. If the story isn't very convincing, it has a strong human undercurrent of reason. It also has many delightful sketches of rural life. By the way, one wouldn't mind seeing what happened to Uncle Hiram when he got the name of everybody in the village down on that list. To err is human, you remember. It oughtn't to take him very long to fill it out and then there'll be no one left to enjoy it.

Perhaps the mother's trick to make the showgirl unveil her sordid character is a little trite, and perhaps the effect of her desire to commit suicide when the only son, whom she idolized, refused to give the girl up, is not wholly fortunate.

One brutal and the other moral, the truest kind of bravery. This film represents a man who had comparatively little of the former, but when all others were frightened at the outbreak of a dangerous disease, he nursed the victims back to health, almost losing his own life in doing it. The film is one of those that appeal very strongly to a sentiment which lies dormant in the heart of every person and always is ready to appear on any display of true courage. It is one of those Biograph sermons that have made a favorable impression ever since they began to appear upon the screens. Through it runs a love story which gives it heart interest and develops more tenderness than would be the case without it.

It pictures a dramatic situation in action; doesn't waste our time and patience by making us watch a baker's dozen of scenes that are not understood and whose whole object is local color. The picture has another advantage in the glorious scenes among which it is set. In one or two scenes the background is used meaninglessly for its own sake and this is a weakness. Also one sensational incident, the boarding of a moving freight car from horseback, is not clear as to its significance and confuses the story, until in astonishment we realize that it was the sheriff on his way to get a doctor for the sick wife of a man who, in great straights for money, had that day snatched a wallet from the very doctor that the sheriff was about to bring.

This sketch might, with no great stretch of imagination, be termed a modern version of ""Taming of the Shrew."" Alcibiades Shamley marries Cassandra, a beautiful young girl with a temper and a determination to have her own way with things in general, also she is devoted to a pet dog of diminutive proportions, called Cara. After the wedding the pup is prepared for the bridal tour with great ceremony, but the rules of the Pullman Car Company forbid dogs being carried on their coaches, so the Shamleys are put off the train. At the hotel accommodations are refused because of a rule against dogs, but the Shamleys manage to find a resting place in the Railroad Hotel by bribing the clerk to admit the dog. Here the pup makes trouble by chewing up the maid's hat. During these events Alcy has been getting telegrams from his wife's folks warning him against her violent temper, the last one being from her Uncle David which advises Alcy to give her some of her own medicine. Previous events convince Alcy that it is now time to assert himself, so he takes Uncle David's advice and starts in to mix things up on the pretense that the pup has swallowed his collar button. By the time he has wrecked the place Cassandra is completely subdued and asks Alcy's forgiveness. The appearance of Mr. Drew in pictures marks a further step in advance in the progress of the photoplay. Though serving his apprenticeship on the legitimate stage, he early elected to cast his lot with vaudeville, in which field he has gained a reputation and a position equal to that held by his distinguished brother John Drew, the dramatic star. To many patrons of the pictures his features will be familiar. His performance before the camera could not have been more satisfactory had he served a long apprenticeship in the picture studio. Good photography and snappy action throughout make this picture one of the most interesting of next week's licensed releases and a feather in the cap of the Kalem Company. - The Moving Picture World, September 2, 1911",United States,George Melford,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001977/,short,1911,

In the meantime, Griffith directed this comedy with his top troupe, and it is a funny and charming affair. Notice Mary's business with West while Nichols is lecturing her, or Henderson's slightly pompous but kind performance.Sennett would produce variations on Father-wants-daughter-to-marry-one-man-but-she-loves-another many times, well into the sound era.

He drops a portion of the jewels in his flight through the forest. An Indian picks up some of the jewelry and almost immediately afterward steps into a bear trap. He succeeds in getting his foot out, but it is badly injured. The trapper's wife nurses his wound and in return he gives her some of the jewels. A deputy sheriff soon afterward calls at the cabin for a drink and sees the jewels. He believes the trapper to be the thief and despite the protestations of himself and his family he is taken to jail a considerable distance away. That night the Indian hears of his arrest and immediately proclaims himself the thief, but no one will believe him. He asks for a horse and is refused. So, though lame from his encounter with the bear trap, he starts on foot over mountain and through forest to give his testimony and release an innocent man. A further search reveals the body of the real outlaw, dead from loss of blood, with the remainder of the booty upon him. The picture is far more lively and interesting than can be described and the characters are worked out with skill and understanding. The Moving Picture World, August 26, 1911",United States,Edwin S.

This Rose (the Biograph Company does not publish the names of its players) makes a very good heroine for such a story. Up to a certain point the climax matches that of Moody's ""The Great Divide."" It was changed to fit this different heroine, who doesn't barter herself for protection to the strongest of three men who attack her, but by her innocence after he has disposed of the other two roughs, she vanquishes him, and he promises to leave her. He has no chance to show this though, for at that moment he is captured, and the Rose saves his life. The story of the film is well constructed and the producer has used a great deal of art in making its tense moments effective. The acting of ""The Rose"" in particular is natural and very pleasing. The chief rough seemed to be very much a gentleman, but the story wouldn't stand realism in his acting. The other parts were fairly well acted.

The home scenes show him and his wife and son meeting the difficulty like real Americans. The rent is due and they need money badly. The winds blow the son's hat off and he picks it up just where a purse with much money in it is lying. The boy brings this home, but just then the winds blowing the newspaper show the boy's father an ad telling him that his old employer has lost the purse. The boy takes the purse to its owner, who is astonished to find whose son the boy is. He writes his address on a slip of paper and lays it just where the bond had been.

The difficulty leading up to her attempted elopement, stayed by these remembrances, is one which might be common enough and could be easily understood by almost any audience. Misfortunes come, and there are certain differences which may arise in every home. Elopements do not always follow but sometimes the tempter is present. The Biograph company has depicted this phase of life with much discretion and with a appreciation of the requirements. The audience was clearly pleased with it and apparently it is of the type that will be understood and liked by almost any audience. - The Moving Picture World, February 11, 1911",United States,D.W.

Such a picture appeals exclusively to the intelligent. The situation is first presented blankly. The spectator can see no possible solution. We then see the detective make small discoveries. They are convincing as clews, but they don't lead us anywhere. The producer's skill is shown by the way he keeps every step that the detective makes from suggesting to the spectator what the next steps will be up to the dramatic climax when we are permitted to see the trap set for the murderer and breathlessly watch him fall into it. This offering fulfills all these requirements very well and is deeply interesting. The artist who was suspected of poisoning the model is Mr. James Morrison; the model is Miss Leah Baird; the artist's mother is Miss Rose Tapley, and Mr. George Cooper play the murderer.

The story is an emotional, homely melodrama, and the storekeeper's role is in kind much like that of Denman Thompson, as Josh Wittcome in ""The Old Homestead."" John Bunny plays it very effectively, giving much humor to it; but putting over its emotional, pathetic moments with power. There was one time when some one in the audience sobbed. The story is old fashioned. The storekeeper's foster daughter, whom he had brought up and loved deeply, was enticed away to the city by the drummer. She thought she could go on the stage and make money to help her old foster father, who had endorsed a protested note. The old man's bitter sorrow is very truthfully shown. He keeps a light in his window for her and, in time, she comes back unharmed. Mr. Bunny is fairly well supported. Miss Edith Halleran plays Alice, the girl; Mr. Delaney plays the drummer. It is a feature; but it is not critic proof, especially in small things. One scene, a hotel in the city, is poor.

tt0002049,Battle of Pottsburg Bridge,1912.0,,,"Drama,Short,War","Unfortunately, this silent film has been lost, and no known copies exist.The last known showing was in 1912 in New Zealand.The story was an actual, true event. A ""Civil War"" battle in which the main character, is tragically killed and his sister takes his place to accomplish the goal of destroying the Pottsburg Bridge in Jacksonville Florida.It was filmed with no sound in 1912 on location in Jacksonville Florida, and became very popular in Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand.Subsequently, the British turned the story into a theater production, and it was acted ""live"" throughout Britain until the advent of World War I.The bridge in question is located on ""Hogan Road"" in modern day Jacksonville Florida, where Hogan Road crosses the ""Big Pottsburg"" creek.The current bridge is the 5th bridge to occupy the space, and pilings from the previous 4 bridges still exist.This section of ""Hogan Road"" follows the original path of the ""Old Spanish Trail"" that the early Spanish Soldiers from America's oldest city, Saint Augustine, used to travel inland to their ""rear-guard"" fort on the St Johns River that they called ""Fort San Nicolas"" in the late 1500's.The ""Old Spanish Trail"" is a 1500's era road, and is the oldest known road to have existed in America. It's exact path from Saint Augustine to modern-day Jacksonville has been lost except for the ""known"" portion where it passes over the ""Pottsburg Bridge"", which still exists today.This only remaining section of the Old Spanish Trail is now called ""HOGAN ROAD"", and is named for the ""Hogan"" family, who were the first ""white"" settlers in what is now ""Jacksonville"" Florida.Saint Augustine is America's ""OLDEST CITY"", and, had it survived, Fort San Nicolas/Jacksonville would have been the nations SECOND oldest city.The site of Fort San Nicolas was located approximately 1500 feet from present day downtown Jacksonville.The actual location of Fort San Nicolas is now occupied by ""Bishop Kenny Catholic High School"", and the surrounding neighborhood uses the ""English"" translation of San Nicolas, aka: Saint Nicholas.The film ""The Battle of Pottsburg Creek"" told the sad true story of the Confederate Soldiers who died defending the the City of St Augustine from a ""rear-guard"" attack by invading Yankee Soldiers who had captured Jacksonville in 1864.The Yankees had captured the Pottsburg Bridge, and were crossing it to invade St. Augustine when Confederate Soldiers attacked in a suicide mission intent on destroying the bridge.The Confederates were successful, but at a cost in life.The film essentially is a LOVE STORY, and ends tragically with the death of the Ranking Confederate Officer, in full view of his sister, as he attempted to blow up the bridge to prevent its use by the Yankees.He was killed before he could destroy the bridge.With the bridge still full of Yankee soldiers crossing the river. The sister dressed in a Yankee Uniform, and attempted to row to the Yankee side of the bridge by boat to finish her brothers task, but when the boat was sunk, she swam the rest of the way, and set fire to the Yankee side of the bridge. The Confederates then blew up their end of the bridge, trapping hundreds of Yankee soldiers on the burning center section of the bridge.The Yankee soldiers dove off the bridge and were captured.St. Augustine was later captured anyway which made this battle so tragic.In reference to the actual ""production"" of the 1912 film, in the late 1800's, most filmmakers produced their ""Summer"" films in New York, and the ""Winter"" films in Jacksonville due to it's warm climate, and established town.Over time, the film crews made problems for the town, and were asked to leave.

The producers eventually exited the train where it ended at an old Cavalry Fort near modern day ""Los Angeles"". The producers then set up shop in that town, and over the next few decades, Hollywood was born, as practically all movie production in the United States moved to Los Angeles.So, funny as it sounds, Los Angeles, and Hollywood, owe their existence to the actions of the City Council of Jacksonville Florida.What irony...""The Battle of Pottsburg Bridge"" was one of the last films produced in Jacksonville for almost 70 years.",United States,Kenean Buel,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0002049/,short,1912,

The family gave a dinner. Billy was one of the guests. He suspected the butler and had some slight grounds; but his host laughed at his fears. This situation is very convincingly developed. The story carries the attention unresistingly with increasing excitement to a thrilling climax in which Billy (Mr. Stepney) rushes out of the house after the butler who is making off with a grip full of jewels and the family silver, only to be himself arrested by the policeman on the butler's accusation. The cop handcuffs Billy and takes him back to the house, letting the butler, who had declared the grip to be full of jewels, to get away with it. This is very weak. It enabled the writer, however, to add some excellent humor which, in its proper place, would have been good. It also made possible an added episode, an automobile chase of the thieves, which wasn't wanted. The acting is good; the sets and photography fine.

Can Edna Foster (the young actress who played boy roles) save his sister Ynez Seabury and himself?Miss Foster's career in the movies was neither long nor particularly distinguished, despite her appearance in D.W. Griffith movies like this, in which her character was the eponymous hero of the film. While her short stature and tomboy ways was doubtless good publicity, Griffith was much more comfortable with actresses who fit his Victorian ideas of womanhood. Miss Seabury had a long but not particularly distinguished career, working well into the sound era as an extra for Cecil B. Demille.Although this movie is, by Griffith's standards, an undistinguished potboiler, the director seemed incapable of making a poor movie in 1912.

In this reel Biograph takes a leaf from some of its lesser contemporaries and indulges itself in the dissipation of a near hanging; the rope is being pulled and the victim is leaving the ground when the rescuing party arrives.

After a while the woman, now with a child, realizes that she was wrong and tries to go back to her husband. This is another moral lesson from Griffith as the film tries to tell women to stick by their husbands no matter what. The film is a little hard to follow as there aren't any title cards to set anything up. It also seems like Griffith really wasn't too involved in the making because there really isn't any of his classic touches.

Their clients never notice this door between; but while the case is on trial, they notice with much satisfaction, the bitter hostility of their attorneys. The fun of this cleverly conceived and well-made comedy comes largely from the fact that we, the spectators, do notice the door between the two offices, we also see the trial and also see how the lawyers behave when their clients are not present. It is first-class entertainment and seems, in its very interesting settings, a bit of life caught up out of some rural county seat when court is in session. The case is Rufus Hanks, a farmer (Wm.

tt0002080,Bunny All at Sea,1912.0,,,"Comedy,Short","The writer has awaited the appearance of this picture with much interest, stimulated, he will confess, by listening to a recital of the history of the picture, from the lips of the comedian, The film is the first of the Bunny abroad pictures, taken when the jovial funny man was on his way to England to secure the Pickwick series. It will make much laughter, there's no doubt of that. One feature of this picture which is novel and unusual is the fact that but one professional actor appears in it. This does not militate against the interest of the film. Understanding it, it distinctly adds to the interest. The work of some of the cast will bear comparison with the acting of the real article. Especially is this the case with the three friends. Likewise one or two of the women. In the cast appears the captain of the Berlin, the boatswain, the entire ship's band, several of the crew, some of the steerage passengers, three of the men cabin passengers and a quartet of the women passengers. As the comedy opens Bunny appears on the deck of the ship, disconsolate as he observes the attention that is bestowed by the women on the captain and the unconcern with which they gaze over his own head. He surreptitiously secures a uniform coat and cap from the captain's cabin and dons them. His fortunes change. He strolls up the deck with a woman on each arm. The captain from his cabin window calls the boatswain, and Bunny under arrest. Then he is made to swab the deck, to peel onions and potatoes, and other menial work. He is finally released and restored to good standing. The last scene is on the deck, where Bunny is surrounded by a dozen of his friends. The best of the comedy comes here. One by one they hastily depart. Mal de mer is responsible. Bunny is the last to succumb; he fights hard, but it is no use. - The Moving Picture World, November 2, 1912",United States,George D.

He seeks the lodging house of Mrs. Mulligan and engages a room. She wants payment in advance, but Bunce can't do that. However, the widow is anxious to marry a second time and sees in poor Bunce an easy victim. Once he escapes, but she brings him back and then takes his hat and shoes so he can't go again. He finds means to acquaint his old friend Barnacle with the facts and the latter comes to his rescue. While apparently sympathizing with the widow he is in reality getting means of escape to Bunce. Then ostensibly he locks him in his room and goes down to bring the minister. Instead, he goes into the back yard where Bunce is letting himself down by a rope. They start for Barnacle's boat. The widow gives chase, but they manage to reach the boat and the picture closes, Bunce smoking his pipe in peace at his messmate's fireside. It might be proper to remark that Barnacle gives Bunce a sound berating for permitting himself to get caught in such a plight.

tt0002087,Cardinal Wolsey,1912.0,,,"Drama,Short","This historical, melodramatic series of scenes suggested by Shakespeare's ""Henry VIII,"" is this week's big release. It is in one reel (1,000 feet); but it is so magnificently acted, costumed, set and pictured that it leaves a very deep impression. The great cardinal is played with most remarkable success by Mr. Hal Reid. This portrayal, we believe, reaches a very high plane of art and is very worthwhile seeing. Even if he were not Cardinal Wolsey, he was every inch a cardinal. Catherine of Arragon is played by Julia Swayne Gordon, who shows the outraged queen in a dignified, royal way that stirs our sympathy. Anne Boleyn is played by Clara Kimball Young, who makes this pretty young lady-in-waiting a bit frightened at first, yet not very reluctant. She seemed somewhat awed by her honors as she passed in the coronation pageant. This out-of-doors parade is the picture's only weak point. It wasn't very suggestive, hardly could be; because the cast couldn't fill the space and there were no spectators, no citizens crowding for a look at their new queen. It would have ""got over"" better, if it had passed through the hall-setting used in other scenes. Teft Johnson played King Henry and, at moments, looked very much indeed like this king's portrait.

It also is a picture of children, played by children, and its climax is a rescue of a crew of youngsters who are in an open boat that is sinking far out from the beach. The thrill comes from the speed of the fast motor boats that the old folks send out to save them. The soul of this story, though, is very different from the other. It gets its individuality from one of its characters, a little girl, daughter of a petulant mother. This youngster knew that the boat wasn't seaworthy. She was in a peevish mood and in an ugly frame of mind especially toward one of her playmates who was with the crowd. We could hear her lips shouting at them, ""Drown; go and drown."" But soon her better nature asserted itself and she got aid as quickly as possible.

tt0002108,The Colonel's Peril,1912.0,,,"Short,Western","A very thrilling picture, telling a love story of army life on the early frontier, and with incidents from an Indian raid that are fresh, natural and convincing. The Bison people have specialized on this kind of picture. They can do other things also, but they do frontier war scenes extremely well. This is only a one-reel offering, but it shows their work at its best. The heroine of the picture (Miss Grandin) is daughter of an army sergeant. The hero, a good-looking young man, is the colonel's son. It opens with a few scenes at the post. The colonel learns of the romance and sends the boy away to an Eastern college. The son gets tired of it and enlists as a common soldier. He becomes a sergeant and is transferred to his father's post. The scenes that follow his arrival are very convincing, and at once the picture opens into a series of real thrills. The soldiers arc called out to punish red-skins who have raided a settlement. The son heroically saves his father's life. The climax is fine as is the pretty, poetic denouement. The photography is good. - The Moving Picture World, July 13, 1912",United States,Francis Ford,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0002108/,short,1912,11

She goes to the length of dressing up as a young man so that she can find out how her husband (John Bunny plays the role) amuses himself. It is absolutely indescribable; but it is very funny indeed. The Vitagraph Company is very fortunate in these two clever players: there is no comedy team anywhere in the business that can match them. In this picture they have made a sure feature.

It is due in large part to the acting and in this picture we like especially the heroine, a cow girl. It is she, who, after securing the real horse thief, holds up her lover, wrongly accused, and collects the reward offered for him. It is her rough humor; he doesn't understand it until she produces the culprit and he is freed. Money is useful in housekeeping. Every player in it acts acceptably.

He is riding the stage in a large box so arranged that he can abstract the gold without being seen. It will then be with him and be delivered with himself and the box in the safe place to which he has directed it. This would have worked out all right had not the stage driver's boy gone out to get a snap photograph of the stage passing the house. The money is missed at the express office and the driver is accused, but the negative, on being developed, shows Bad Bill leaning out of the big box and with his hand in the small one. This incident, in spite of the very conventional trimmings with which the central situation is surrounded, makes an interesting offering. The characters are merely figures. William H.

The redskin himself is far from good; he is very much alive and is the real hero of the story. Other very attractive things will be found in the picture that will help in its popular appeal. In a wide country, a large immigrant train is attacked by as numerous a band of Indians. One of the white men breaks through and warns the soldiers at the fort, who effect a rescue at the critical moment. This messenger puts the Indians who are following him on the wrong trail by one of the cleverest ruses in pictures.

It is not a romantic picture so much as a drama of passion. It is set in Mexico and is told in simple homely backgrounds without the aid of glorious scenery. When the American was called home by his company, he had to leave the pretty Mexican girl. He had taken a fancy to her and she was in love with him. She was passionate and her love turned to hatred when he told her that he was going to leave her. A Mexican loved her, and him she promised to marry if he would cut out the American's false heart. This he agreed to do, and rode fast to the village, went up to the American's room at the hotel, and waited for him. The hotel keeper left him there with the gas lighted. Here is where fate intervenes. The yokel doesn't know about gas. He blows it out, in order to spring upon the American in the dark. He is smothered. It lacks the surer elements of popularity, and, while it was closely watched by an interested audience, it brought out no enthusiasm, no applause. The photographs are fair and it is a competently made picture. We don't dare call it a Saturday night feature. - The Moving Picture World, April 20, 1912",United States,D.W.

tt0002173,The Father,1912.0,,,"Drama,Short","Scenario by Bannister Merwin. A story of a poor clerk who betrays his employer's secret for a large bribe in order to send his only daughter, who is sick, to the South. There is nothing new in this situation except what is due to skill in handling scenes or the plot. The denouement shows the clerk rewarded for his crime. It is true, as a wise poet has said, that mankind can find charity in man for his short-comings and not in man alone, for the gods, too, pity; but their pity doesn't abrogate the ten commandments. The world is so full of sentimentality to-day that this denouement will probably please nine spectators out of ten, and chiefly because they don't consider. Emma Goldman would call it just and right, but even if we all agreed with her, it wouldn't make it so. It is simple unvarnished anarchy. The picture is well acted by John Sturgeon, as the father; Mrs. Wallace Erskine, as the mother; Miss Learn, as the daughter: Mr. Chas. Ogle as the employer; Mr. Rob. Brower, as the doctor, and Mr. Wm. Bechtel, as the briber. It is well photographed. - The Moving Picture World, July 13, 1912",United States,,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0002173/,short,1912,

It is one of those pictures in which the atmosphere itself furnishes the story.

It is good to look at, although it is a trifle sad in its general idea. But that is easily compensated for by Mr. Brooke's rare technique, which is displayed in this picture to the limit. The story is along the lines of the Music Master: that of an old theater musician who found a waif and cared for it until the Children's Society agents came to claim it. The old man and his companions had become attached to the child and the portrayal of the grief of the old musician in parting with the child constitutes the theme, which is carried out in a masterful manner. The story does not descend into any mawkishness. Suffice it to say that it is Van Dyke Brooke at his best.

tt0002185,The Flower Girl's Romance,1912.0,,,"Drama,Romance,Short","A tragic picture taken on a flower ranch in California and full of beauty, of scenery naturally; but of human things also. Jane Wolff is the story's heroine, the flower girl whose heart is piteously wounded. Miss Wolff has usually played older roles and it is with agreeable surprise that one finds her so adequately filling a part that needed youth and comeliness. We have long been noticing her work and have seen it as the saving grace of more than one picture. She is most certainly among that not too numerous group of players of distinctive talent. The story is of the simplest, but in those scenes in which Miss Wolff shows a young girl's sorrow, it is deeply significant. She has indeed accomplished something more than a portrayal, at least in the best part of her work; she has almost identified herself with the flower girl whose love had been wakened by a man already engaged and who later sees how matters stand and is compelled to gather flowers for the wedding. The picture is not wholly comprehensible, chiefly because the hero's character is shown in only a sketchy manner. He is drawn as distinctly not a villain and yet is shown as making love to the girl. For the first half of the picture we felt that perhaps the producer was going to make the fiancée turn out to be only a sister. We had been seeing many other pictures and perhaps owe the producer an apology although it was the producer's weakness that sent us searching for some explanation. Again, we cannot help feeling that to cut off the last two hundred feet would help the offering. The last three scenes consciously asked our pity for the heroine whereas those that immediately preceded them were content merely to show us these reasons for pity, They were sincere, true and very effective and were followed by a distinct anti-climax. As an offering the picture is desirable. The people will like it. Wm. Herman West plays the girl's father; Carlyle Blackwell the man, and Neva Gerber, a very pretty girl, very acceptable in this role, the man's fiancée. - The Moving Picture World, December 7, 1912",United States,George Melford,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0002185/,short,1912,

Very plainly it was made by a producer who knew his business and from the script of a man who can prepare a scenario and get a situation over. As for the acting. Mary Fuller plays the daughter of a counterfeiter (Charles Ogle), who consents to make himself scarce in the neighborhood for her sake. As he was about to be arrested, it doesn't seem a very noble action, but the story didn't demand that it seem so. William West plays an old waiter who has taken a fatherly interest in the girl and in her love story. Harry Beaumont plays the son of Mary's rich employer who in the end marries her. Robert Browcr plays Harry's father and Bigelow Cooper, the detective who has arrested the girl's father once and is on his trail again when the story ends.

It is a modern picture of society life, in which a wise-hearted girl sacrifices herself to protect not only her sister from misplaced passion, but her sister's husband from knowing it. The meaning of the picture is much deeper than its name indicates. It faintly suggests from what seed and in what ground the girl's wisdom had grown. The handling of the situation, especially as regards the acting, might have been a bit less constrained by convention; but that is merely a matter of opinion. It is an effective and commendable picture. It is set in and about a fine country place, with, extensive and beautiful grounds and tasteful interiors.

As it is, up to the last scene, which is tremendously effective, the interest in the story's outcome, while always awake, is secondary to the picture's lesser qualities, its acting, lighting, scene making and photography, which all are of high order. The story of the old composer's loss of memory and his separation from his friends, and even of the homecoming to die in the empty theater where he had just heard his great opera rendered, are not impossible; but they are not made very real. There is plenty in the picture that does ring true and the scene where the composer dies is fine. The acting all through is excellent. Mrs. Julia Swayne Gordon plays the composer's wife; Edith Halleran and Norma Talmadge play his two daughters, and do excellent work. - The Moving Picture World, June 8, 1912",United States,Charles Kent,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0002196/,short,1912,14

As he is about to jump a caring young woman stops him and tells him that God loves him and that he shouldn't give up hope. He is thankful and embraces her and they separate. On a bread line a hobo gives him some of his food wrapped in newspaper and the young man sees a message in the personals: ""Come home Charlie, all is forgiven. I am dying. Father."" The young man races home and embraces his dying father. We cut to several years later and the young man is now rich, hanging out with snobby friends. He has a beautiful girlfriend and wants to propose to her but as they walk around town together and pass the same bread line the young man had once stood on he confesses to her about his past and she laughs at him. He decides this beautiful girl is too shallow and not worthy of him.Suddenly he remembers the caring young girl who stopped him from committing suicide near the bridge, and he becomes determined to find her.

The picture is desirable, because the action is thrilling throughout both reels. It is not a one-reel picture padded into 2,000 feet of film; but a bona fide big feature picture. It is breathlessly dramatic and. though not a single situation picture, the center is kept fairly close to the little log cabin all the time. The photography is of a quality that could hardly be improved and renders the commotion and dread, scattered over a big country, it seems, by the horde of reds that descends upon it very stirringly. At the end, we should have been shown the Indians, not only beaten at the fort, but driven out of the valley, because the cabin seems still unprotected after all that nightmare.

He is shown as a ninny and we can't help feeling that he was only made so to give a situation. Again, the withholding of the evidence of wrongdoing until the climax was ready is in this picture so unconvincing that it fails of becoming a true part of any story. Mary Fuller plays a hard part very well indeed, as do Charles Ogle and Willis Secord, who take the roles of two scamps.

The work of William West, as the grandfather, and of Bliss Milford, as the tired and overworked woman, also add much to this fine picture. Augustus Phillips, Chas.

tt0002222,Greater Wealth,1913.0,,,"Drama,Short","It seemed to us that the audience was divided on this picture, some thinking it good and others not liking it so well. There is reason for both views. Its object is to create a feeling of patriotism and love for the Stars and Stripes as the flag of equal opportunity. Whether or not it is, and how much it is so depends on one's personal viewpoint and there lies the picture's weakness. It contrasts the home life of a rich man with that of a poor man. In both homes there is sickness; but the poor man's child recovers, while the rich man's dies and he besides has a drunken son to trouble him. The poor man is an employee of the rich man and is discharged to lessen expenses. In the end he attempts to murder the employer, but is persuaded to look at his wrongs in a different light. There are some very beautiful pictures, especially of the two rooms where the little girls are sick and these pleased some very much. Twice in the course of the story the flag is insulted, once by a labor agitator and once by the man with murder in his heart, and this displeased two who sat directly behind us. We didn't get much pleasure from it because it is quite plainly insincere. Lanier Bartlett, the author, has done better work ; but much credit is due Colin Campbell for the skillful way he has directed it. Thomas Santschi plays the leading role as the poor man, while Hobart Bosworth plays the rich man. Bessie Eyton, with Little ""Baby"" Wade, plays the poor man's wife and the mother; these two made some of the loveliest scenes in it. Those who played the laborers, Frank Clark, Edward James and others deserve credit, as does Fred Huntly as the doctor.

Indeed, in my own family is the tale about children taken by Indians many years earlier in PA and the mother killed--she was upset with Indian men coming a number of times for food and it is generally thought she got what she deserved, which seems a bit harsh as a lesson to always be nice to everyone. :) The Indians in this are all dressed to the nines and the Whites are bedraggled. I'm not sure if that was symbolic. The chief looked very out of place among actual Native Americans. It doesn't appear they killed the bison that lay heaving on the ground through the whole encirclement scene, unlike in Greed where it surely seemed as if they first used a trip wire and then shot the horribly twitching mule. Ghastly. Of course what the directors did to the actors was often not much better.The White mother was evidently quite well fed and corseted in firmly, both of which would have been unusual because of the rigorous conditions of life as a settler. The Indian mother had only one gesture during all her mourning scenes and it started to irritate me. The White woman had more but they weren't very believable.The music was really dull and I was struggling to keep my attention on the movie until it was over. I tried to notice other things, such as the use of four oxen to plow. I have no doubt that it was still possible to find an old wrangler who knew about things like that to use in the film. In fact, four years after this was made, in the Texas Panhandle, Charles Goodnight invited his Indian friends to his ranch from their reservation in OK for one last buffalo hunt which he filmed. (His ranch later became Palo Duro Canyon.) He had been both friend and foe to Indians over the years, and he had been one of the saviors of bison by breeding them on his ranch. If a person had grown up in the West in the period before The Indian Massacre was made, he or she might have had a more nuanced view of Native Americans than Easterners did.I'm giving this movie five stars for the maternal angle and the historical ties that showed the makers of the movie had not yet totally given in to the ""savage Indian"" genre and had tried to show we have much in common, even if it is that men fight and women mourn. Soon WWI would be upon us to show another way in which that was relevant. (I do not endorse that view; I only mention it used to be prevalent.)",United States,Thomas H. Ince,Thomas H.

This is a modern story, a story of mystery and the most mysterious character of the picture makes the queer mark on paper. It seems merely the result of a nervous habit, but leads in the end, to his detection. The intrigue is to obtain a fortune which depends on a will, disinheriting a worthless son for a niece. The detective work is done by a reporter who loves this girl. The picture holds attention strongly from the start and its climax is very tense. The will has just been placed in the hands of the worthless son by the man of mysterious habits and is already on fire when the reporter and the girl bring the police and save the document. It is not a picture that demands great acting; but is carried forward very smoothly and speedily by the players and the producer.

tt0002244,His Lesson,1912.0,,,"Drama,Short","Here is another tract; but one that is in part very artistic. It has good acting and a very tense climax with breathless suspense. One scene seems over-careful in its plainness. The effect is as though one were reading in words with divided syllables. It deals, as all good tracts must deal, with a homely, simple and very human situation and presents it to us very effectively. It is almost universal in its appeal. The husband runs his farm; his wife keeps the house, does the cooking, washing, cleaning, sewing, churning and what not. The husband is ambitious and hard-working; but he is not affectionate. He is saving money and laying up for himself, his children, and perhaps his grandchildren, a good reputation and a hard heart. His wife is more human than he, is of finer fibre, has needs that he won't recognize and is being mercilessly worn out. The man gets a sharp lesson and profits by it. The picture ought to go home to a good many people. It is pretty well photographed. We liked it; the audience also seemed to like it. The lesson comes through a sportsman on a fishing expedition, who stops several times at the farm house and wants the woman to run away with him. - The Moving Picture World, June 1, 1912",United States,D.W.

tt0002245,His Mother's Hope,1912.0,,,"Drama,Short","A picture that manages to make clear the subtle methods of mental activity, and most dramatically. The first few scenes lacked plausibility; they were conventional and poor. They show how a mother and father lost their only son. The mother dies, but asks to have the boy's room kept just as it was. When the actual story opens the boy, not knowing who he is, has grown up, is married, has a son of his own, and is out of work and in despair. He burglarizes his father's house and is caught. From this point the action leads to a mutual recognition. It is not done suddenly or crudely, but step by step, through mental association, faint impressions at first grow naturally, and by what they are fed on into convincing memories. In making the development from misty ideas to palpable fact real to the audience, the producer deserves high commendation. We don't think it could be made clear to the gallery; we are sure it was over the heads of some in the audience, but to the imaginative it was like food and drink. George Lessey, as the father, and Barry O'Moore, as the son, bear the burden of the work, but Bessie Learn helps a good deal. Gertrude McCoy plays the mother; Louise Sydmth, a governess; Marty Fuller and William Porter play the two boys. - The Moving Picture World, December 21, 1912",United States,Charles Brabin,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0002245/,short,1912,11
tt0002246,His Mother's Picture,1912.0,,,"Drama,Family,Short","This motion picture asks us to sympathize with a ""wanderer,"" because he shows a fondness for his mother's picture, set in a small metal frame and his only treasure. He also saves a girl whose shoe was fast in a frog between the rails, and does it at some risk. But when he loses his picture and learns that the girl has found it, he does a skillfully accomplished ""second story job"" like an old hand at that business. The girl, finding a burglar climbing in her window, bites him in the arm so hard that, next morning, the mark serves as identification (this was neatly done and helps the action) and a novel chase ensues. Someone had thought up the new chase and the picture was plainly made to accommodate it. To get it over, the leading player had to put himself in considerable danger; but none the less, it was artificial and thin. There are several conversations in the picture that add nothing, even stall the action for a moment. There is some good in it for everyone and the uncritical may like it as a whole. - The Moving Picture World, October 26, 1912",United States,Kenean Buel,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0002246/,short,1912,

The players do not look directly at the light, but upward, for the most part. This gives a strange effect; and while most of its scenes are tremendously impressive, in one or two of them the light seems unreal, and these scenes are not strong.

The action is nearly always significant of human things and nearly always it is carried forward with a sweep. Biograph weakness shows itself in the relief. When the picture is nearly all tragic we are not moved deeply. It gets a strong hold when some contrast deepens the picture by relieving the tragic cloud as against the eternal calm, the blue sky of life. There are psychological reasons for this. The picture before us was taken in a lovely forest country and the camera has caught tome perfect views of it. The main thread is played by Claire McDowell and Henry Walthall with a second man, a very competent player. The Mary story, whose purpose was solely relief, is carried by a young player who wasn't quite up to it. As a whole, it makes a striking picture; but it deals almost wholly with passion and never reaches the deeper human interest. The worst that can be said of it is that it wasn't a very happy choice for a silent drama. It will astonish more than please. - The Moving Picture World, October 26, 1912",United States,D.W.

The trap that later ""gets'"" the adventurer she fastens to a stake, which is driven into the ground with a tap.

Miss Edith Halleran and Wallace Reid play important roles as a married couple, friends of the lovers. Miss Turner's acting, and as far as that goes the acting of all the principals, gives more than one pretty moment to the picture, which, however, doesn't afford her any real freedom. It is not shown to fair advantage. The plot, the story itself and even the backgrounds, which appear disjointed, keep the picture from rising very much above commonplace.

The story is quite fresh throughout, although the situation or situations very close to it have been used many times. The unusually high quality of the work comes chiefly from the almost faultless naturalness with which the story is led forward by the producer who astonishes us at times by the unconstrained way in which a group of figures in its scenes, with the perfect illusion of unconsciousness, affect each other. The ability to accomplish this is often considered to be the surest hallmark of a true dramatist, and even prized above clever plot construction. The camera work and the sets and backgrounds are perfect and add much interest to the story. We are shown the rather selfish society matron in financial straits, and her pretty daughter who has awakened the love of a middle aged, good man of wealth. We are now shown a glimpse of married life as these two found it, with heart-break ending in reconciliation. Beside these three characters, there is the younger man and many really human beings who perhaps enter the little sphere in which the story seems truly to live. - The Moving Picture World, May 4, 1912",United States,D.W.

tt0002288,A Juvenile Love Affair,1912.0,,,"Comedy,Romance,Short","A most charming picture, almost wholly poetry, giving a love story, with an elopement of two precocious youngsters. Little Dolores Costello and Kenneth Casey play the leads. The former, a very good little actress, is as winsome as can be as the latter's little sweetheart. By the setting and costuming, we should say the story happens in 1830 or a bit before, and in some Southern city. Mr. Harold Wilson plays commendably the role of white-haired darkey coachman, who solemnly promises not to tell of the plot to elope. He is a very amusing darkey. The elopement is soon an open secret; but it goes on, nevertheless. The real parson won't marry the kids, so Master Kenneth compels the son of the darkey coachman to read the service. Fresh, bright, amusing and pretty; it will probably be liked everywhere. In the cast we see also Miss Rose Tapley and Harry Mayo, as the girl's parents; Miss Theby and Mr. Newburg, as the boy's parents.

tt0002291,Kentucky Girl,1912.0,,,"Romance,Short","A race track melodrama of a kind that may safely be warranted to get over with a big, emotional thrill. They all do, when they are well put together; this one does, but they are all very much alike. This one is not quite so good as the best we have seen; but it is pretty effective and has some first class race pictures. There are two stereotyped ways of working out this situation. One is to make the villain ""dope"" the jockey, compelling the girl to ride in order to pay the inevitable mortgage. The other is to have the villain frustrated in an attempt to ""dope"" the horse and then confound him on that basis. This picture chooses the latter. Its one fault lies in the fact that it has two heroes, the girl's brother and the jockey whom she kisses. Because it doesn't really tell a love story (all melodramas should, that is what they were invented for) it is weakened. Among the other releases, it makes a good offering. - The Moving Picture World, August 31, 1912",United States,George Melford,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0002291/,short,1912,

It really needs a sound- effect growler, which will make it a hair- raising offering. The Selig people were the pioneers in this peculiar kind of picture, and we are glad to say that they have distanced all competitors and even gone ahead of their own former work. A point has been reached where the animals appear in the jungle background of the picture and also come out into the foreground, where the action of the story depends upon them, with absolutely convincing naturalness. The effect is startlingly realistic. The story is simple and not melodramatic. A young pioneer and his wife live with their little girl in the jungle. There is a misunderstanding and the woman, with her child, starts off across the jungle to her mother's. They are in a bullock cart: but. at night, are attacked by lions; we see three big ones. The husband, who with a friend, the innocent cause of the misunderstanding, follows, rescues them. It is a big picture, a sure feature that will please every audience. - The Moving Picture World, November 16, 1912",United States,Colin Campbell,Otto Breitkreutz,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0002293/,short,1912,21

Maria goes to see Guido, and promises to sing one of his compositions. She does so, and the song is a success.

He is killed and a good case of circumstantial evidence is built up against the hero, who is next seen abandoned on the desert, with his hands tied behind him. The pictures in the Indian camp are good, and the problem of the hero, who has become a squawman during his life there, is interesting. But at the close of exciting scenes, he rescues his former love from captivity, his squaw kills herself, and he rides away, with his papoose behind him.

tt0002310,The Little Bride of Heaven,1912.0,,,"Drama,Short","A story of the slums by Mary Imlay Taylor. It is not, strictly speaking, a religious picture. Its characters are mostly Roman Catholics and it tells how a very poor little girl got a white dress for her confirmation. She thought it came, a miracle, in answer to her prayer to the blessed Virgin; but there is nothing in it to offend religious sensibilities in any one. It is set in the very slattern rooms of a congested city district except the last pretty scene, which shows the procession going to the church, choir boys, the priest, little girls in white and the two nuns that follow. It is a fairly effective offering, pretty well acted. Miss Mary Fuller, as the child's mother helps it out a good deal, although all the older players act very naturally indeed.

tt0002311,The Little Organ Player of San Juan,1912.0,,,"Drama,Short","This picture lacks the artistic photography that it needs; good photography seems scarcer than some months ago and this is a pity, for its effect on the impression given to even the most ignorant spectator is marked. This picture deals with the effect of music on people, even on a wild mob, to make them reverent. In one or two scenes it succeeds in making us feel the music by sight alone, which is something; but there is too much that reminds one of the producer's troubles in making the picture and it seems artificial. It was plain that the girl at the organ bent awkwardly down to let the light shine upon her face. There was another woman, in the mob, whose lack of acting spoiled one whole scene. Perhaps Colin Campbell, the producer, didn't give Lanier Bartlett's scenario the best chance of making good; it has possibilities. Thomas Santschi, as the priest, is just what was wanted; Bessie Eyton, as the motherless orphan who grows up to play so powerfully, makes a very strong appeal in the center of the picture. We didn't recognize Camille Astor in the old Mexican woman that she plays so well. Wheeler Oakman and Eddie James play two Spanish dons. - The Moving Picture World, January 11, 1913",United States,Colin Campbell,Lanier Bartlett,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0002311/,short,1912,

But in comparison with others of its kind, this very improbable and not very carefully made story of an English nobleman and an American mamma with two daughters and a stepdaughter suffers. One scene seems quite carelessly made. It shows the Cinderella (Clara K. Young), slipshodly dressed, coming into a room where her mother and sisters, in stylish clothes, are seated. We haven't been prepared by any insight into her state of mind regarding her short skirt, and for a moment she seems slovenly and is cheapened. Lord Browning's attitude toward the girls (he had merely heard about them as Americans) is super-romantic, and Cinderella is also cheapened by her attitude toward him, whom she has also only heard of. The authoress is Josephine W. Crawford, and the producer, Van Dyke Brooke. Maurice Costello is Lord Browning, Julia S. Gordon is the American mamma, Flora Finch the oldest, and Leah Baird the middle daughter.

It illustrates a somewhat watery poem that had a good idea which it treated sentimentally. Its center of interest is a poor little raggedy child who got a job as fairy queen in a Cinderella production. This, as shown, seems highly improbable when there are so many more available children in the world. If her mother had been a once famous star, it might have seemed more convincing. The little tot steals the magic wand hoping to change the complexion of her mother's cheerless den through its power. This brings the manager to her attic and results in the inevitable basket of groceries. The great trouble with the picture is the child player, who never for a moment forgot the camera and was quite wooden throughout.

The action takes place mostly in their kitchen and sitting room, of which we see very well photographed corners, just enough to make us think we are in the room. We also get a glimpse of an office in Chicago, where the heroine, a stenographer, opens the mail order of one of the farmers. He gives a large order, then he adds that he also wants a wife. She considers a while then she corresponds and a few weeks later comes out with the purpose of marrying one of the farmers, but finds in the other her long lost, but still loved, sweetheart. - The Moving Picture World, January 13, 1912",United States,,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0002337/,movie,1912,

tt0002351,Master and Pupil,1912.0,,,"Drama,Short","Stories dealing with artists and studio life have attracted scenario writers and producers, but most of these pictures have too plainly betrayed a lack of real acquaintance with the subject. This Edison release is another in which Mr. Harry Furniss leads, and Mr. Furniss is to the manner born. The picture shows it; it rings true from first to last. It has also human qualities in marked degree and is, we think, on this account the very best picture of its kind that we have seen. It is a story in which the interest centers in the relationship of a pupil with his master. In all of this it is most delightful and full of past experience; and in the way it is brought out, full of kindliness and human sympathy. There is a secondary interest which is also good; but, if the picture has weakness, it lies in this love story. The chief theme is so worthy that some may doubt whether it were wise to divide the attention. From the showman's viewpoint and that of the average spectator it was the best thing to do. Beside Mr. Furniss, Miss Mary Fuller and Mr. Wadsworth play the important roles. Miss Fuller is very charming as the master's daughter and the pupil's sweetheart.

We don't think that real militant suffragettes will like it wholly, its a bit too sharp for that: but it is good tempered, if it is witty, and was made for the average spectator. If cranks see themselves in it as others see them, so much the better. Marguerite Snow plays, with her usual grace and charm, a society girl. She meets the Chugworths, man and wife. They are English militant suffragettes, whom it would be fun to meet anywhere. These two players are clever enough to keep from burlesquing the cranks too much and they make them seem like real people. The outcome of this meeting is very laughable, perhaps most because it is humanly probable, but it is acted naturally by all in the cast. James Cruze plays the heroine's fiancé. It's a real comedy, worked out with a good deal of brilliance and will make a first class offering. - The Moving Picture World, December 28, 1912",United States,,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0002363/,short,1912,

tt0002399,"Oh, You Ragtime!",1912.0,4.2,28,"Comedy,Short","This is a very standard French vaudeville gag but would not necessarily have been familiar to US audiences. Feuillade's La Bous-bous-mie (1909) for Gaumont does have similarities (although ""the servants at play"" belongs to a slightly different genre) but there had also been the earlier Gaumont film, Le piano irresistible (1907), also about a musician who has just moved in, and then Pathé's La Valse à la mode in 1908 featuring a young and very lanky Maurice Chevalier (often high on cocaine in those days). The version of the latter available on the internet is silent but the Pathé catalogue is quite specific about the music involved and it should have The Merry Widow as accompaniment. Here Chautard has virtually just americanised the story, replacing ""waltz"" by ""ragtime"" and ""The Merry Widow"" by Alexander's Ragtime Band"" in the first part. Again the music to be used for accompaniment is made quite specific by showing the sheet-music on the piano. For the second part he reverts to a waltz (not specified although I suspect the title was originally visible). It is a pleasant little gag - essentially timeless - that, suitably accompanied, was sure to play well in a cinema.The general idea of ""irresistible dancing"" is re-used beautifully by Max Linder in one of the finest scenes in his US film, Seven Years' Bad Luck. To work well the gag really needs the central character to be ""hyper"", which was very much the case with both Chevalier (the cocaine would have helped) and with Linder whose ""Max"" (seemingly so suave and respectable and totally different from ""Charlot"") is always close to the edge.",United States,Étienne Arnaud,Étienne Arnaud,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0002399/,short,1912,5

Several motion pictures have presented the same idyllic story as this Selig offering does, and some have also given it as memory visions that look back from the present to days before the war and war times. Several have made skillful use of old songs to help out some picture story, but, so far as we know, no one before has got as much American experience in one picture as Hettie Gray Baker has in ""Old Songs and Memories."" It is tremendously effective to such as remember war times. The present reviewer does only through his kin, but he, too, was deeply moved. There were people in front of us who frankly dried their eyes. Few Americans of the generation it pictures will fail to see their own story in it. But it might have been much more effective if more carefully done. The soldier pictures might have been much more natural, and the photography is poor.

tt0002412,An Outcast Among Outcasts,1912.0,,,"Drama,Short","A good melodramatic picture with strongly worked-out and very interesting contrasts.

The blanket stiff is made a semi-cripple. This subtlety intensifies the distinction between him and the yeggs. Another strengthening contrast is in making the heroine's character, in this picture, whose chief purpose is to draw a rough and harsh experience, that of a sweet, unspoiled and very lovable girl and with all such a girl's helplessness. Her lover is skillfully drawn also, and sharply distinguished. The story is a little complicated by minor threads; but works out to clear and very effective climax.

The film presents a psychological study of character dramatically, and gives a fresh criticism of life. The subtlety of it makes it a hard picture to comment on; one hesitates as before jumping into a very deep pool. But very crudely we may say that it draws for us a not very well balanced girl. She is somewhat morbidly conscientious and, consequently, not popular; but the humanity of her heart, as shown by her longing for friends, her longing to be understood, makes us deeply interested in her. Very logical is her reaching out to her new friend, her first sweetheart, and since he is what he is, a tragedy of some sort is imminent. The suddenness with which it comes shatters her mind. It is a picture that most certainly ought to be liked. No mechanically working mind could possibly have conceived it and we commend it as a work of art.

There is good action in the hero's rescue, because, at the bottom of the cliff, he falls in the hands of yeggs and is carried away unconscious. He is saved by the heroine's recognition of a trinket she had given to him, in the hands of one of the tramps. The scenery in the backgrounds is very beautiful and the picture makes a very fair release. The girl is played by Lillian E. Christy; the man, a doctor, by Carlyle Blackwell; Wm. H.

It is a story of the attempt of an unscrupulous manufacturer to get possession of an invention of a young man. Unwilling to pay a fair price for the model, he employs the adventuress, who is in love with him, to get the coveted article, promising to marry her in case she succeeds. The story is weak in one respect, and that is where the adventuress goes to the young inventor and draws a revolver with the intention of taking the model by force. Even had she been successful in getting the invention out of the house and into the possession of the manufacturer, there was no chance of her ""getting away with it."" Also, where the sweetheart of the inventor overhears the two plotters she is so palpably and plainly in view of the two that the scene loses all effect. With these two exceptions the story is excellently put on and holds all the way. Carlyle Blackwell, William H. West, Lillian Christy and Mrs. Dunlop all do good work. - The Moving Picture World, November 2, 1912",United States,George Melford,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0002433/,short,1912,

Whenever this is done with art, the popularity of the offering will be assured. This picture will, we believe, enjoy a good measure of success. It shows, in different backgrounds and with new characters, a hymn as recalling so strongly his innocent boyhood to a criminal about to add to his wrong doing, that he relents and breaks down. This time, he is about to shoot his own, unrecognized, brother, the judge who had once sent him to prison, when the brother plays the old hymn. The two boys of the early scenes are William Bodie and Judson Milford. In the later scenes they have grown up and are now Knute Rahmn and Carlyle Blackwell. Wm. H.

He is saved by his would-be killer's grand-daughter, marries her and shares his wealth with him, which makes him a better person.It sounds trivial, and by the standards of the era, it probably was. Essannay alone turned out over 70 westerns in 1912. But the movie is interesting because it shows how modern film grammar was beginning to gel. The acting is still very broad; the compositions that bespeak the stage with its proscenium arch clearly marking the limit of reality, so prominent in 1908, are vanished in just four years; and the story, although a tad slow, is interesting.",United States,Arthur Mackley,Arthur Mackley,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0002440/,short,1912,8

tt0002454,A Reconstructed Rebel,1912.0,,,"Drama,Short","A picture that opens, as far as its action is concerned, with a few war scenes just after Lee's surrender. The hero, a C.S.A. colonel (Hobart Bosworth), refuses to take the oath of fealty to the Union, and, with his little daughter, escapes to a strange country where he raises the Stars and Bars and lives an exile. The picture's object is to work up, with increasing patriotic fervor, to a climax in which the Stars and Stripes can be shown gladly waving on the staff above the reconstructed colonel's house. To accomplish this, a United States consul with his son are introduced, and a love match made between the colonel's daughter and the young man. The fervor is created by making the inhabitants hate the Americans, by a riot, in which the flag is dishonored, by making the fiery colonel leap into the breech for the flag that once had been his, and finally by bringing a great United States dreadnought across the sea, and by having the white uniformed tars save not only the Stars and Stripes, but the Stars and Bars, too. The colonel was won by love, and himself hoisted the Stars and Stripes. The picture gets over, but it has too many unconvincing smaller things to be called a big picture. The camera work is only so-so. Because of its quality, it will be liked. It was applauded on Broadway. - The Moving Picture World, June 15, 1912",United States,Colin Campbell,Emmett C.

There also were two or three unnecessary scenes that dragged. Poor photography kept several scenes from being truly alive.

tt0002469,The Root of Evil,1912.0,,,"Drama,Short","In our opinion, the most interesting picture of the week. It seems, at the start, the same old situation. The rich man's daughter has secretly married her father's secretary and he finds it out and disowns her. Then we have the widow and her child coming home in time to thwart the designs of the man who is scheming to obtain the old man's fortune. It is apparently the same old story and yet how different, how much more humanly convincing than the best pictures of this story that we can remember. Its vitality comes from the peculiar characteristics of the persons; they are not types, but new individuals. These persons dramatically affect the narrative, the path the story takes toward its denouement, in a willful, lawless and yet entirely natural way. It seems inevitable. The interest doesn't center in any one character; it is merged in the whole. Yet the characters are very clearly cut and two of them (the child and the designing ""legal adviser"" of the old man) are intensely interesting studies. The man who plays this schemer seems to be a new player among the Biograph people and, if so, he is a noteworthy addition to their forces. We might add that a good player is fortunate in starting with the Biograph Company. He has a better chance of making a reputation than in most places. - The Moving Picture World, March 30, 1912",United States,D.W.

tt0002472,"Sammy Orpheus; or, The Pied Piper of the Jungle",1912.0,,,"Comedy,Short","A picture likely to be popular because of its novelty, but as a story rather than as a comedy. The humor doesn't seem quite spontaneous. There is a mighty good idea in it. Sammy can play on the pipe like a very Orpheus; every one who hears must dance. That's the difficulty; no one can work while he's around and he is always in trouble. At length he lands on a South Sea island where they like his music too well, so he escapes to the jungle and finds a congenial spirit in an elephant, who carries him around and, in hours of relaxation, dances to his tunes. The subject was hardly one to be treated as a fantastic yarn such as a sailor would tell. It is at heart poetic and has an atmosphere inimical to such scenes as that in which the fat, darky chieftainess makes love to Sammy. It would have been better if all of it had been a little coarse or all had been poetical; with two aims, it doesn't hit anyone very hard. Thomas Santschi plays the lead. Bessy Eyton, appearing for a moment, does the best work in it. Besides these, there are in the cast, Eugenie Besserer, Lillian Hayward, George Hernandes (the cannibal queen), and Bunny Feeham. That restaurant scene is very well handled.

The usual bad man hasn't very much to do with this story; the sheriff chases him out of it in the first act. On the way back from the state line the sheriff is able to help a widow whose horse has run away and wins a bride. Arthur and Julia Mackley play the leads and give us an amusing sweet scene for a final. - The Moving Picture World, January 4, 1913",United States,Arthur Mackley,Gilbert M.

tt0002492,A Siren of Impulse,1912.0,,,"Romance,Short","Early last summer, the Biograph Company released a very excellent picture, ""The New Dress."" This release has much of the same quality. It is true that the former had, in some ways, a more significant incident to relate and was more universal in its humanity. It also was more distinctly national in its ancillary happenings, in its atmosphere. This picture, however, has many good points to commend it, points that are found in both. It is not quite so successful a picture; but it invites comparison. They belong together. The heroine of this one is an impulsive Mexican girl and later a married woman. Her peculiarities have made her husband intensely jealous; yet she is perfectly true and submissive to him, is even more good-hearted than the usual man or woman and it is really through this good nature that the situation came. She had loaned her finery to another girl, because her husband refused to let her go to a dance. A sick neighbor needed her care. Her husband came back and found her gone. From a distance, he saw her dress. In the moonlight, there came near being a tragedy; but this was averted and everything explained. The picture's fine quality comes in the acting which, in many of its scenes, is quite up to Biograph standards. The photographs, some of them more especially, are unusually commendable. It is a desirable feature. - The Moving Picture World, March 16, 1912",United States,D.W. Griffith,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0002492/,short,1912,17

Its complicated plot is kept perfectly clear while the story is unfolded. It shows us the newspaper man in wide-awake need of a good story and making intelligent use of chance meetings and apparently insignificant happenings that help him eventually to uncover a criminal who had broken into a jeweler's. The reporter proves himself a good newspaper man and at the same time wins a girl. Miss McCoy is an individual wholly unlike any one else who plays in the pictures and her originality is distinctly pleasing. She is an asset to the picture. Mr. Furniss's jolly self also is pleasant to watch. He gives an intimate friendliness to a picture. He makes the spectator feel that he too is a good fellow. Very fortunate is Mr. Furniss. Mr. Willis Secord is an actor, no one who watches his work will doubt it. Mr. Charles Ogle and Mr. Harry Eytinge also appear; we have often commended this work; they do well here.

There are only ten hundred feet in a reel, and when too many of those hundreds of feet are given over to a dialogue between Anderson and the woman of the company, without any apparent object other than featuring, it is a question if this will interest other than the lovesick moonstruck letter-writers. The story itself is unmoral. Anderson takes the oath of deputy sheriff. The smuggler's daughter, his sweetheart, sneaks in behind the deputy when he has the smugglers under his pistol and puts her hands over his eyes long enough for her father and his companions to turn the tables. Then she goes to the sheriff and notifies him, following which she warns her father in time for him to make his escape.

tt0002503,The Spirit Awakened,1912.0,,,"Drama,Short","A story on a farm that happened to be mortgaged. Taking part in it are the old farmer, his invalid wife, their light-haired, young daughter, two farm hands, and a girl of the neighborhood who appears only for a moment. The chief contrast comes between the two helpers. One, the slighter, is a Christian who believes in turning the other cheek, while the bigger man is somewhat brutal, also he has the courage of his evil desires, but lacks the wisdom to have good desires. There is also a subtle contrast between the two girls. The protected, yet not wholly protected, farmer's daughter, is happy and contented in her normal life, while the other girl, called ""the victim of the renegade"" is one of the most pathetic figures we remember seeing. She shows lack of direction (not artistic direction, let us quickly add it); even the awkward way of fixing her hair and the queer hat deeply stir our sympathies. Such little things tell us a volume of human heart- history that lies behind them. As best she can, and most piteously, she reaches out to the brute for a little love and sympathy, a little heaven- light in a dark world. This character is a very sincere piece of work. In this picture, the producer brings these characters forward with the sole aim of making us thoroughly acquainted with them. Thus he convinces us first of all that they are real people. They have lived before the picture opened and we feel that they are going to live after it closes. All he cares for, at first, is to make us feel the contrasts, which by the way is the only way we know one person from another. They are introduced in small groups. When he has succeeded, he brings forward something that will hold the attention of all his active characters. In this case, it is a sum of money, money for the mortgage. Around this all the characters suddenly begin to react together. First he mixes the powder, then he adds fire and we have the general explosion. The climax is a thriller. In the denouement there is humor and much pleasing humanity. It is a well photographed and very desirable picture. - The Moving Picture World, July 6, 1912",United States,D.W.

When it turns out that there is a parade of Civil War veterans, though, Fred is happy to steal Ford's old uniform and medals to wear and impress Alice Davenport with them.This Keystone from the first year of the firm's operation looks like it was one of their ""stolen shot"" specialties, with the flashback sequences to the Civil War photographed against an Ince spectacular (like COHEN SAVES THE FLAG) and the parade borrowed from an actual event. This was a common technique for the first couple of years of operation, resulting in some spectacular effects for little money.

He then suffered all the poignant repentance that such a youngster would be likely to feel. He saw the necessity of returning the money and started to earn it, one penny at a time, so that he could make the restitution. The state of mind that led up to this resolution, the difficulties he encountered in making the money, the inter-reaction of the boy and all the characters with whom he came in contact and the effect on them when his repayment disclosed the situation are all very dramatically and skilfully shown.

Oddly enough, the two loveless ones detest each other.

Her mother, Kate Bruce, has an important supporting performance, which she plays perfectly.

tt0002513,The Sunset Gun,1912.0,,,"Drama,Short,Western","Mr. Bannister Merwin, the writer of this picture, scores in it another emphatic success. It is a stirring, human and deeply truthful picture of an old soldier's last Memorial Day. There are village scenes, a parade of veterans to the cemetery, and the old soldier's dream memories of the war. He dreams of morning roll call, of battles, of the sunset gun and of taps blown over the sleeping soldiers in bivouac on the field of battle. It is grandly done, and very emotional. The people applauded warmly. Let us impress upon exhibitors that such a picture as this, it is in truth a masterpiece, deserves some special preparation. It will repay it. It needs good martial music, drums, fifes and bugle notes, at the very least. Don't miss such a chance of making an impression. This picture plus good music will be worthwhile. Mr. Mark McDermott plays the old soldier, we almost said is the old soldier, so worthily does he set him forth. He will win a host of good friends by this picture. As it is, as a player, he stands second to none in the estimation of people who appreciate art and imagination. He has won his reputation outside of romantic roles and on account of ability alone. The picture is so good and true that although a large crowd of onlookers watched it in making, all of them seem to have a natural place in it. They were feeling what it stood for. The actors had lost themselves in it and, strange to say, the uninvited but welcome watchers also had. It is excellent on every count. Miss Miriam Nesbitt is the soldier's daughter; Yale Boss is his grandson. Among the G.A.R. men are Charles Ogle, Robert Brower, Wm. Wadsworth, Harry Linton, Wm. West, Guy Hedlund and Edw. Boulden. Following the G.A.R. men march a group of school children, in white with flowers and little flags. Then come the citizens.

She, then, cannot make her escape; but is rescued just before the burning timbers fall by her sweetheart, the fireman (played by Wallace Reid). The story is of the simplest both in plot and handling; but Miss Story's acting succeeds in making it very emotional. Her power in this field is widely known and recognized; she has made more than a few weep by her art. In pictures like ""The Telephone Girl."" the means she uses are of the simplest; she seems to lose herself in the story. Such a story as this, however, doesn't give her the scope she has shown herself capable of making use of. It is an A-1 picture of its kind, exciting and deeply emotional.

In addition to this and fortifying this there is in the interpretation and execution of the plot real class. In spite of the fact that tragedy is the predominating note of the reel and a half, there were several points where an adult Fourteenth Street audience found occasion for hearty laughter.

The son had married an actress, and the father had refused to let him come home even to spend Thanksgiving Day.

It is the home of the heroine and her sister, both very pretty and good players, and is one of the best Southern sets we have ever seen. The hero comes to the house, when the Union forces are there, as a spy, and is wounded in trying to escape. The girl carries his message on and not only saves the Confederate camp, but causes the capture of the Union forces. These things do not powerfully convince. The photographs are fair. If it were all as good as the best scene, we could safely call it a popular feature. It has the popular things in good measure.

tt0002546,Two Daughters of Eve,1912.0,7.9,31,"Drama,Short","There are persons in the picture industry and out of it who bewail the fact that the personnel of the Biograph Company has undergone changes. So it has. Good people have gone to other companies. Likewise, good people have returned, and also good people have made their debut. In this picture it may truly be said that Biograph has put over another Biograph. It is a story with a wallop, to borrow a term from the bowlers. There is a triangle, to be sure, but the third member was drawn into it through motives of revenge, and perhaps measurably justifiable. A little child, left alone for a moment by its parents, gets out of a machine and wanders into the wings of a theater. The mother in her search for the little one, discovers her in the arms of an actress, extremely decollete, by the way, and denounces the stage girl for contaminating her child. The father remonstrates with the mother and apologizes to the actress. The next night the father has a front seat at the show. There are effective scenes showing the theater and the audience, and flashes of the stage and the dance; the father and the actress exchange glances. The friendship is formed, the mother takes the child and goes out for herself; the father meets with financial reverses, the girl throws him over. The mother, as a last resort, seeks employment in the chorus. There she comes face to face with the third corner. The manner of the actress, scornful and sneering at first, changes to pity. She puts out her hands to a sister in distress. The stage girl takes from her neck and arms the jewels the husband had given her and forces them on the wife; she goes to the wretched home of the mother with her. ""Now may I kiss the baby?"" inquires the actress. Yes, she may. The stage woman does more. She meets the husband, and sends him to his wife. There is a strong scene, ending in reconciliation. The stage girl is new to the company. She is an acquisition. The work of the mother is powerful; she has never been seen to better advantage. Mr. Walthall took the role of the husband; he also was at his best. - The Moving Picture World, October 5, 1912",United States,D.W.

That is until he learns that the girl is leaving with her husband (Christy Cabanne). Embarrassed, Joe goes searching for them for revenge but when he finds them both are near death due to lack of water. Will Joe seek revenge or do something good for once? This here is a pretty good Western that goes back to what Griffith was doing in New York and that is telling morality stories. There's a small chase scene, which is pretty well done, although it's no where near a classic scene for the director. The ending is also very well handled and comes off quite good, which is something the director was great at.

On this account, the picture is instructive, as showing this peculiar phenomena in a most vivid way. Nothing could be plainer than the story, as it is developed, and it makes a deep impression. We commend it as a picture out of the ordinary, one that will excite discussion of a kind that will advertise the houses where it will be shown, as well as motion pictures generally. Two musical composers, very close to each other in their friendship, love the same girl. The more original of the two is crippled by an accident and the other wins her. He didn't know how dependent he was on his friend for musical ideas, and after the marriage and the friends are separated, his work loses quality. The lonely genius has become famous. He hears of the distress of his friend and the woman whom he loves, but his offers of help are not accepted. He has a new composition and feels sure that it will make him famous. He also knows of his strange faculty, and, although a great distance separates the friends, he throws his music into the other's heart, giving it to him without his knowing. It is very well acted by Mary Fuller, Augustus Phillips and Barry O'Moor.

It is not a horrible picture; many of its scenes are extremely beautiful, especially those showing the Everglades with the quiet waters and tangled growth of its forests, their trees covered with ""graybeard"" moss. The man was innocent, was convicted and suffered with other prisoners. A girl of the country pitied him and, when he escaped with others and bloodhounds were set upon their trails, she hid him. He was recaptured, however, and later pardoned; then he returned to her. The story is good, interesting and full of acceptable freshness. The escape and chase are both very well managed.

tt0002575,What Katie Did,1912.0,,,"Drama,Short","Edna Hamel makes an effective appeal in this picture as a poor little girl, a mother's helper, whose natural kindliness is rewarded in the end. The story is carefully made and has a fair measure of dramatic suspense; there is only one place where, so it seems to us, it is weak. The treatment of the little girl in the shop of the milliner where she is working after school as a messenger seems conventional and more in the atmosphere of a select school than of a shop; the poor seldom treat each other so meanly. Fellow workers in the shop would probably have helped Edna, not wantonly caused her expense; they would have known how it feels themselves. The author, Charles M. Seay, deserves credit for a human story that makes good entertainment. Kathleen Coughlin has the role of a younger girl whom Edna finds lost and sees home. Bliss Milford plays Edna's mother; William Bechtel, the doctor, and Alice Washburn, the boss milliner. - The Moving Picture World, January 4, 1913",United States,Charles M. Seay,Charles M.

It has a very strong last scene, in which the king has his ""favorite"" and his cousin entombed alive together, because he suspects them, unjustly. But the early scenes, while clearly dramatic, are much weaker. The scenes and backgrounds pass very well for Versailles and its courts and fountains. The acting is graceful and competent. There are many figures. These, with its thrilling, but happily ending climax, make it a desirable picture.

What does that mean in this context, when Griffith was supervising all of Biograph's production? Did he direct part of the movie and Cabanne the rest? Did he retake some scenes, or did Cabanne? Did Cabanne act as second unit director before the term was coined? Did their bosses decide that it looked better for the trade papers if Griffith was credited as director?I can't tell anything from looking at the movie. It looks like the standard Biograph product at the time, with fine camerawork and performances. The story is a little corny, but not particularly so for the Victorian-minded Griffith, even if Cabanne was the writer.There's an almost automatic tendency to downgrade all of Cabanne's efforts, based on his Poverty Row westerns made on non-existent budgets thirty years later.

The story is freshly conceived, new and interesting. The leading role, the heiress, is a fortunate one for Alice Joyce and she fills it very pleasingly. Tom Moore, as her father's secretary, plays the other romantic role which the story makes secondary and conventional. Isabel Vernon, as the girl's mother is not always sure in her drawing and Richard Purdon, the father, though natural, is also conventional at most times. The offering stands on its story, its pretty scenes and its fine photography and.will be much liked by all kinds. - The Moving Picture World, May 24, 1913",United States,Edmund Lawrence,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0002604/,short,1913,12

tt0002620,Altar of the Aztecs,1913.0,,,"Drama,Short","An unusual picture with an extremely interesting atmosphere. It's naturally a love story and deals with the discovery of a rich gold ledge once known to the Aztecs, but long lost. It probably was suggested by a real temple of prehistoric Mexico some good views of which are included; but its author has carefully laid out his plot and the picture shows none of the haphazard looseners that has begun to seem almost the rule with photoplays made to order. It opens in New York and with some perfect interior sets in the home of a rich merchant whose daughter resembles an old painting of an Aztec princess, her ancestress. This fact plays no part in the story, it is brought in merely for atmosphere, an atmosphere, by the way. that the picture doesn't pretend to develop. In the novel of this type the girl usually has something to do with finding the mine; is looked upon by the natives as a goddess or something of that kind and the scenario writer perhaps knew that the spectator would follow the well-known clue and that his picture would get an added touch of mystery. We commend him for it, but wish that he could have taken the time to make two reels or more; he shows that he can be interesting. The author is J.C. Cowks and he knows how to make an acceptable picture, and Henry McRae, its producer, can put one over. Hobart Bosworth plays the American mining engineer who discovers the ""lost ledge"" and so wins the girl, who is played by Phyllis Gordon. Henry W. Otto plays the girl's father and F. Galves and A.E. Garcia have parts as Mexicans. The photography is of the best and the offering plainly took the audience into camp.

We are sneaking only of today's regular releases. It is an interesting offering, with a good deal of freshness, without anything that can be called at all new. The hero is a diplomatic officer in Washington who has got into debt buying lovely dresses for his wife. The foreign spy tempts him and he nearly falls. The chief difference is that in most pictures of this situation the girl is a princess only by right, while here she is a princess by both right and title. It is both well acted and beautifully photographed. Alice Joyce is the princess. Tom Moore is the hero; his way of showing determination is, in this picture, almost amusing for just one-half second, E.L. Davenport is her father, the king; Naomi Childers, her maid, and E.P.

The production was made in Paris under the direction of Herbert Brenon, and throughout the whole story bears the impress of its maker, Mr. Baggot's work is of marked strength. Leah Baird, in the role of the sweetheart of the anarchist, gives an interpretation that will appeal to all. The rival of the anarchist is deserving of praise for good work. So also are the gendarmes, especially the chief, who, by the way, are gendarmes and not actors. There is a child in the picture who will win all hearts. She played her part with the skill of a veteran. Heart interest is established right at the beginning of the picture and is maintained throughout; and there are many situations of strong suspense. The climax is one that will grip. The rival of the anarchist has notified the police of his whereabouts, and they are pounding at the door of the cellar where he makes bombs. His sweetheart has warned him. With a bomb in his hand he awaits the breaking in of the door. He hears the faint notes of a toy horn. It is blown by the little girl to whom he has just given the instrument. Flashes show the child sitting on the floor above playing with two kittens. The hand of the anarchist drops; the police enter and make him prisoner.

Its quality is more like sparkling ice than a laughing summer breeze. John Bunny flirts with Kate Jones across the air shaft, and Spinster Finch has her eye on them.

This second personality is a cruel man and he ends up helping a thief break into his own house not knowing any better.I will admit right here that I had to watch this silent film with German title cards and I really couldn't follow that much of it. The basic premise is quite simple but obviously there are things I missed not having English subtitles. With that said, it's pretty simple to see why no company has come to the rescue as there's really not too much going on. We see the main character in a few different situations and while it's somewhat clear they're reworking Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, there's just very little entertainment here.",Germany,Max Mack,Paul Lindau,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0002628/,movie,1913,48

William Shay has the character of the son, grown to manhood, and Jane Fearnley, that of the mother. Both do excellent work, as in fact may be said of the entire cast. William Welch, who portrays the Savior, is especially effective in the final scene. His characterization is reverential; the effect is heightened by his craftsmanlike makeup, in which, by the way, Mr. Welch is unusually efficient.

The producer let many small things make this picture inartistic and very unreal. That college scene is as untruthful as it is trite. It would be a poor college where seniors could live that kind of life; freshmen who try usually get dropped. Another scene showed a shop girl's poor friend lending her an expensive looking dress. Alice Joyce plays the girl who is fired from the dry goods store and who gets a job from the artist (Edgar L. Davenport). The younger brother is played by Tom Moore.

There are two parts to it and one of these is a story of business life and the other is all kinds of a historical sport and doesn't help the business story very much; has touches of unintentional comedy and is altogether, we believe, a mistake. This story of business should have been kept wholly as a business story and there was plenty of chance to do so, as the author's one pertinent, illustrative incident amply shows. The idea is first-class and, even now, with all the historical incidents left scrupulously out. it would be a good offering. As at present it is Bannister Merwin's worst recent failure. There are some fine characters in it. The hero, Benjamin Wilson, does some really astonishing work in his picturing of five different figures; he is especially fine in his portrayal of Wentworth, Sr. at the time of the panic in 1834. and as Wentworth, Jr., changing from a weakling into a man of sense. Dan Mason's picture of a kindly old family servant is also worthy, as is William West, in the old clerk of the house. Every play, with one exception, is commendable.

But it has a good, live theme and gives an insight into loan shark manipulations, as well as showing the danger of getting into the clutches of such men.

The value of the opening scene, which throws into strong light the emotional character of the brothers, especially of the older one, is felt at the end, where, by a fortunate chance, a terrible tragedy is averted by hardly more than a moment. The picture is not harrowing, for one feels after it is done that those two brothers must be the very closest of friends from that time on through their whole lives. The story was speedily produced, and perhaps was projected a bit too fast, at any rate, it seemed just a bit obscure in one or two places; yet even under these conditions it was very effective. In the characters we find that same respect for truth that we have come to expect in pictures from the Biograph studio. Both the brothers and that queer ""non-committal girl"" were clearly imagined and most certainly rung true. As for the girl, we know one who is in many ways like her, one of the queerest people we know, a truly country character. The ""leaders"" seem unusually poor to us. The use of the word ""lady"" instead of girl is a bit stilted, and we think that the screen explanations might have been made clearer. The photography is fair.

One of its features is a series of finely photographed pictures of race horses in the race. They were taken over the back of a motor car and bring out the frantic emulation of the losing horse when the competitor is passing him. In fact, the offering is full of horse nature and beautiful horses and this is just what is wanted in such a picture; we know that all who love horses will take great pleasure in it. It is safe to say that, on account of this, it is the best racetrack picture we remember. It has another feature, in that Budd Doble himself plays the leading role and drives the winning horse. He is perfect as a racing man, not a bit ""camera shy"" and gives a most convincing touch to it. Supporting him, is Bessie Eyton, as Rosebud Doble; George Gaffney, as Doble's driver; Frank Clark, as the villain; and Wheeler Oakman, as his son. The script, by Frank Clark, was produced by Colin Campbell and both deserve much credit.

Griffith made his pieces in this vein morally ambiguous, preferring to raise questions without coming up with answers in which he himself had little faith. Christy Cabanne takes a much more melodramatic position: the rich *are* evil, the rich *are* hypocritical and the poor and downtrodden will suffer at their hands.Which is a superior line to take? I admire Griffith's ability to tread that narrow line, to excite questions that are still unanswered -- but for pure story telling, Cabanne's methods are better, particularly given that Biograph's audience was poor and urban -- just the sort that feels oppressed by the rich. And while he only has a few of Griffith's best actors -- Alfred Paget, Bobby Harron and Donald Crisp in particular -- it was a pleasure to recognize an improbably young Alan Hale.

Yet there is much in it that will attract and, in scene making, backgrounds, lighting and photography, it shows high merits. It opens with an artistic lamplight scene in which the heroine (Luray Huntley) is discovered telling her own fortune with cards. They prophesy a romance and, though she is a married woman, she starts out to manufacture it at once. This love story of hers with the man who has come from the city, especially her going to him at night after she has betrayed her smuggler husband (Stewart Holmes) to the officers and thinks him dead, could not be a love story and all that follows is out of joint and quite illogical; even the characters change. Jim's way of spending the hush money he gets from her is strange. It has action, broken-backed and disjointed as it is, and it has moments of prettiness. The staging (William S. Davis produced it) is excellent; the story very poor. - The Moving Picture World, October 4, 1913",United States,Will S. Davis,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0002738/,short,1913,31

Good, well-thought-out letters help the story's impression, letters that are much better than usual. Markedly histrionic acting, especially of Elizabeth Miller as the detestable wife, but also of William Bechtel, as the worried businessman, and of the two children, give noticeable punch to the early scenes and again in the later scenes, where the qualities here noted compel our emotion. As a whole, the story gets over and easily makes us believe in it, though there are some scenes that are decidedly weak. The servant should not have needed to show the children where to wash up at their grandma's; then that scene where the parents see the children after the accident also failed to convince. - The Moving Picture World, December 6, 1913",United States,,Mark Swan,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0002742/,short,1913,

We dare not call it entirely successful, perhaps it has attempted to make clear things that are too subtle. That part, for instance, that deals with the relationship of the man and wife will be understood by all, after the first few scenes. But when we come to the burglar and the relationship of him and his wife with the tragically misunderstood woman, we get the picture's intention, but are not convinced. We don't believe that even a gentleman burglar would behave in just that way.

While it seems improbable yet it is not impossible that a lighthouse keeper's dwelling should be separated from his light by a stretch of water. There are effective close views of a revolving light in action; but the distance views are of a stationary lamp. Al.

I can only conclude that whoever put that credit up - which is just about impossible to remove; I have tried to fix various errors of this sort over the years, and an IMDb credit, like the law of the Medes and Persians, altereth not. Anyone who thinks that D.W. Griffith had a hand in directing this overstuffed sausage has never seen this movie; if he has, he has never seen a D.W. Griffith movie made after, oh, May of 1909 at the latest. Me, at just saw it at New York City's Museum of Modern Art.Miss Gish is okay, and Bobby doesn't have that much to do, but everyone else overacts and the set is so cluttered you can't make out the Biograph Right Wall, which gives depth to the image.While it was true that Griffith had a supervisory hand in all Biograph movies at this point, his involvement was pretty obviously minimal.

It does show worthy effort, however, and has a sort of educational value, in spite of its inartistic effects. The early Puritan scenes in the first reel are very good, but the makeup of the hero and his conduct in visiting the girl during her parents' absence gave us an erroneous impression of his character.

Then the author didn't carefully guard our sympathies away from the villain of the story who, as the rich man's nephew, was counted heir until the girl came and, so it seems, supplanted him without good cause. The hiding of the will was not strong, nor was the snatching of the first will from the old man by the nephew in an early act. One can make a will as many times as one pleases.

The scenes are all extremely interesting; nearly all of them were taken on a freight train in motion and the suggestion of speed in the runaway train is more marked than in any picture of its kind we remember. The sense of danger and the thrill are most convincing. Alice Hollister plays the girl with Earle Fox and R.G. Vignola as two railroaders, rivals for her affection. The former wins her; the latter fixes things so that the freight will run away and at a time when it had bee» ordered to make a siding to let a passenger train pass. The girl lakes the desperate chance and side tracks one train just in time to save her lover's train from a catastrophe. It is all very well done indeed and the offering will be liked greatly.

An effective scene is the view of the burglar at work on the house safe; he is shown in the rays of a flash lamp with his ear at the lock listening for the fall of the tumblers.

tt0002816,The Drummer of the 8th,1913.0,5.9,131,"Drama,Short,War","This early silent short film by Thomas H. Ince, ""The Drummer of the 8th"", is available today in a good looking and tinted print well transferred to home video and may be worth watching just for that reason. Otherwise, it's a rather average film for its time. It's one of the films Ince made in anticipation of the 50th anniversary of America's Civil War; it's about a boy who runs off to enlist with the Unionists, against his parents' wishes and to follow his older brother who already enlisted.There are some brief, poorly staged and filmed battle scenes, which I think compare unfavorably to even the battle scenes in Ince's earlier Bison Westerns, such as in ""The Invaders"" and ""Custer's Last Fight"" (both from 1912). Besides the battles in those Westerns being longer, they created more excitement by alternating between long vistas of large-scale fighting and closer views of main characters. The battle in this film fairs even worse in comparison to those by D.W. Griffith and ""Billy"" Bitzer, such as in the same year's ""The Battle at Elderbush Gulch"". The camera takes a fairly close long-shot position in ""The Drummer of the 8th""--just close enough to let us see some details while hopefully not noticing its small scale. The larger problem with the sequence in this film, however, is that it completely fails to follow the axis of action: North and South appear in separate shots to be charging from and to the same direction, rather than towards each other. Regardless, this is a very old and short film, so further criticisms seem needless. It was even made before happy endings became established in the industry. Otherwise, ""The Drummer of the 8th"" does have decent production values for Nickelodeon fare. There's also a brief flashback during one scene.",United States,Thomas H.

It is a strong arraignment of the convict labor contract system, the story being arranged by James Oppenheim. Rosemary Theby and Irving Cummings play the leads. Views of a knitting mill are shown and also numerous prison scenes and pictures of convicts working on the state farm in New Jersey. The observer is always conscious that he is being influenced against the contract system, but the story itself has sufficient dramatic interest to give it appeal. We liked particularly the closing scenes in the halls of the legislature, where Mary and John bring in the crippled brother and make their plea before the Assembly Committee.

The ""Crow"" is a tramp, son of a rich man. He had been disinherited for drunkenness, but his father, on his deathbed, has relented and the sweetheart of the heroine, the ""Crow's"" foster sister, goes out as a hobo to find him, followed by a detective in the employ of the rich man's lawyer, who doesn't want the son forgiven. The love story here is secondary to the tramp story, which is a novel and pleasing bit of romance. Henry Otto plays the ""Crow,"" H.A. Livingston, the man who goes out to find him; William Hutchinson, an engaging tramp who helps Livingston; Kathlyn Williams, the foster sister and heroine. All do creditable work.

One will ask many times during the picture, ""Why doesn't the man break a window pane to get in?"" The expense would have been much less, for the taxi waiting before the door till morning cost $15.50. This keeps the comedy dull, it fails to get over strongly. The authoress is Mrs. Victor Koch, and it was produced by Ralph Ince. Harry Morey and Anna Stewart play the leading roles as husband and wife, who are locked out. Josie Sadler plays the cook; Florence Ashbrooke, the other girl, and James Lackaye, the cop; all add to the fun.

There's a goodly amount of location shooting about Rotterdom and Scheveningen, a slow-motion boat chase, and an obviously carefully planned fall into the water.

He then braces up and becomes a good workman. In the way the picture is written and in its general conduct it is a typical Biograph story. The action is held in pretty closely to its center of interest, and the scene-making searchlight snaps back and forth from one actor to another and seems to pick out the different elements of the situation almost simultaneously. This is a speedy method and makes the picture, as a whole, clear at the expense, now and then, of the acting. The scenes change so fast that the players now and then seem all arms and hands. Mae Marsh plays the girl; Kate Bruce, her mother; W.C. Miller, her father; Harry Carey, her sweetheart. On the other side of the situation are Charles West, leader of burglars; Del Henderson, a loafer with a comical run; Alfred Paget, a saloon keeper, and the policemen.

When the girl's new step mom arrives she objects to gramps heavy drinking so the old man packs up and heads out so that he doesn't ruin the young girl. A month passes and the family finds him in a poor house and it might be too late to help him. I really wasn't expecting too much out of this 30-minute short but it turned out to be a real gem with a great story and some fine direction. I think what impressed me the most was the direction, which was very loving from start to finish and in the short running time Ince is able to make us care about this old man. There's a subplot about a Southern General who comes looking for the old man and this allows us a pretty big action sequence taking place during the Civil War. Again, there's nothing grand scale about this scene but the authentic uniforms and all the canons firing really makes this sequence stand out. I think the biggest thing going for the film is its actual story. Yes, it gets a tad bit over dramatic towards the end but that really doesn't take away from the heart and soul of the picture. Taylor is extremely good as the old man and we also get future director Frank Borzage plays his son. At the very end of the film we get to see an actual funeral for a decked out Civil War vet and it's not only quite touching but as a part of history its really interesting to see.",United States,Jay Hunt,William H.

Charles Ogle was excellent as Mad Carew and Laura Sawyer appeared to advantage in the part of Alice, whose request for the idol's eye brought death to her lover and lowliness to herself.

Her role is that of a mother who rules with an iron hand, who is arbitrary, self-willed. Her characterization is impressive, rugged; at times it. gets into your throat. Henry Walthall plays the strolling actor, Dorothy Gish the girl in love with him. Charles Mailes is the clergyman whose services are interrupted and who halts them to denounce and put out the man who dared to pass a note to a member of his congregation. All deserve praise. The scenes where the blind mother, her money gone, rolls up her sleeves and goes out and nearly falls into the uncovered well; later, when she again goes to the well, this time determined to end it all, but is saved by the returned couple, are full of pathos, A film to be featured. - The Moving Picture World, July 12, 1913",United States,D.W.

The old mother comes to the city to look him up, and in a few interesting closing scenes finds that he has just done a good deed and is ready to make a man of himself. Such pictures have a worthy, wholesome effect, and since the story is well told and clear, this one will be acceptable to all classes. Ormi Hawley plays the old mother and makes her a character that is human and real.

As it approaches its climax, the scenes, flashed back and forth, keep the action concrete and almost breathless. But this playing for the thrill is not the best use of the motion picture camera; for in such there is almost no individual acting; everything goes to situation, nothing to character. It justifies itself at the box office; but so does the higher kind; the first has a more immediate, the second a more lasting effect. Blanche Sweet, Kate Toncray, Charles West.

Maurice Costello plays an English official in India who, to get a mother for his two little girls, marries again (Clara Kimball Young plays the new wife). The stepmother neglects the children. She had awakened the resentment of a fakir, played perfectly by James Young, and this ""devil priest"" makes gruesome use of the children's longing for the love of their new mother; he tells the youngest of them to put some liquid he gives her into tea to make her love them and it is done. The children keep the picture from being wholly convincing, and Mr. Costello, in running, after the catastrophe skips as though he were glad, but this is not logical. It is well staged.

That vigorous-minded mother is a new character and, out of her, the situation is made to spring very convincingly. In the development of this we find the same traits appearing in her son; but now they are used not tyrannously, but valiantly to save the weak old father, the sister and the poor boy (a favorite character with Biograph) and this gives the offering a very pleasing ending. Walter Miller plays the son; W. Christie Miller, the old father; Mae Marsh, the sister and Robert Herron, the poor boy. All the players do clear cut, commendable work.

Jack Hopkins is the rube who is rejected by the girl and tries to make trouble for the city fellow who is his successful rival. A flirtation starts in the city, but is shortly transferred to the country. The best of the comedy is in the ""business,"" which is unhackneyed and fresh.

Its story is one covering a vast range of human emotion; it combines skillfully the fierce passion of the Mexican heart, as shown in Don Jose's hatred of the artist and his religious creation, the Madonna. Then the picture, again admirably, utilizes the vast sweep of the Southern California landscape; we see the railroad builders at work, the Indians in their picturesque village on the lakeside, and later have the crash of warfare. The old mission atmosphere is always in evidence and the pictures are excellent. The crucifixion scene impressed us as too strong for presentation, and many exhibitors will prefer not to use it, no doubt.

But Griffith has some nice shots of her down at the beach, shot against the setting (or perhaps the rising) sun.In fact, it's not absolutely sure that Griffith directed this one-reel movie.

There are improbabilities and inconsistencies. The boy grown to manhood under the domination of the gypsy obtains employment as a chauffeur when nothing has indicated that he had ever seen a machine. Later, he takes back to her old home the daughter of the countess, kidnapped twelve years before, which proves he knew how to find it and consequently could have done it at any time during these years. The dropping of the letter of proposal at the feet of the chauffeur was hackneyed. Ralph's escape from the tower of the castle, his sensational climb over the wires to drop then into the water, and his long swim back to extinguish the burning fuse attached to the bomb necessarily required far more time than would have been required to consume one foot of slow match. On the other hand, the ""firefly"" scene in the theater was finely done. The tinting from one color to another as the woman swung in the air. suspended by a wire, made an unusual spectacle. The photography is of high quality. - The Moving Picture World, October 11, 1913",Denmark,Einar Zangenberg,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0003002/,movie,1913,47
tt0003003,In Convict Garb,1913.0,,,"Drama,Short","This two-reel subject holds interest very steadily throughout the greater part of the picture. Too much is made of the pursuit of the handcar on which the escaped convict and kidnapper of the warden's daughter is trying to get away from his pursuers. It is overdone. The fleeing prisoner must have jumped his handcar over the two dead handcars standing on the same track, as revealed in the flash showing the warden's automobile. It is hardly probable also, that a man turning state's evidence in an unsuccessful burglary would still be in prison five years after the commission of the crime, especially as a trusty. It was forcing a situation to put in as warden of the prison and over the convicted cashier the man who won a wife by reason of his rival's downfall. In the print seen the warden's wife twice descended the stairs from the room where the whistle rope was. It appeared like a retake overlooked. The prison scenes are exciting, and are well put on. E.H. Calvert was strong as the convicted cashier, although inclined to overact in one or two scenes. Ruth Stonehouse played well in the role of the wife of the warden. - The Moving Picture World, October 11, 1913",United States,Harry McRae Webster,Harry McRae Webster,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0003003/,short,1913,

The fact that he seemed to he of no great use in time of war is shown as telling against him in his love story. Respect, honor and love are falling to his rival who, at the front, has been promoted to a lieutenancy and seems to be a very gallant man. The one-armed rival goes to the front as a reporter and, at a time of fierce fighting, rallies his rival's company and leads them to victory and then writes the story up giving the other man the credit. After the war the lieutenant is conscience- stricken and confesses to his own cowardice, so that the one-armed man at length wins the girl. There are battle scenes that are full of action and the story is told clearly, and although it is a bit too romantic to be convincing, it isn't dull. In the acting there are some pleasing things and there are many very good scenes.

He proves himself not only strong enough to kill his rival, the tribe's stalwart warrior, in a struggle for the girl, but is able to make a magic flute which can and does restore the girl, now lying dead. In the closing scenes, the picture shows a short glimpse of modern life which suggests that the old myth is being played, in part, again. This kind of picture doesn't give the same punch that it did when newer; but, in this case, it is poetic and interests. The photography is clear enough to tell the story, but lacks the quality of liveliness, isn't artistic. It was written by Lanier Bartlet and produced by Colin Campbell.

It is the circumstantial evidence situation showing how an impossible bank was robbed after its cashier had been killed in a most improbable way. But this gives beginning to a story of the north woods with the action and the atmosphere that still interests. In the general conduct of the story of the rough life there is an earnestness and a vim that makes almost all of it seem real. Spectators like to see a fisticuff struggle when, it is as well done as at the climax of this. On the whole, it makes a very fair offering and justifies itself as a feature.

There is a strong scene when the wife, driven from home, seeks refuge in the home of the man who on account of his prison record had allowed Joyce to slip from him. The two are alone in the house. The ex-convict resolves the problem by departing and leaving his home to Joyce. There is a distinct punch when Joyce, after discovering the body of her dissipated husband in the woods, is joined by the man she has always loved and learns that he has likewise loved her.

The object was to create a feeling of mystery, and this was accomplished but at the expense of a clear-cut impression. Yet the guessing is not unpleasant, and the offering seemed to entertain a large audience. The players are very acceptable.

We find the three brothers who leave the ranch to seek, gold, which they find, and die; are killed accidentally yet because of their greed. The tender-hearted son, who remains, gets married and is happy, though poor. Most of what takes place around the gold hole doesn't convince strongly. The weakness of the picture is that it stands for something rather than is something and the mind denies the harsh side of it. because, since the author is seen consistently building up a statement of opinion, we, on our part, are led to be critical. - The Moving Picture World, June 7, 1913",United States,D.W.

A villain is provided of course to furnish the danger to the heroine. She is about to jump into a net with which he has tampered. The most important role in the picture is that of her husband, the clown, and his tipsy struggles to save his wife were watched by all with breathless interest. Leo Delaney, who takes the part, deserves much credit. Norma Talmadge also does very fine work; she too gives a decided touch of character to her part. Courtnay Foote is the villain. Walter C.

tt0003052,The Last Blockhouse,1913.0,,,"Adventure,Short","In this two-reel subject the Kalem Glendale studio shows us what it can do in the way of an Indian Western picture. Producer George Melford has used as a basis for a stirring melodrama an actual incident in the early history of the Far West. He has selected his backgrounds with great care; he has shown fine technical skill in placing his camera so that these backgrounds are revealed to us in all their grandeur; and excellent photography adds to the charm of the views of mountain and dale. There are many scenes of big fields, one of them reminding us of the effective setting of the attack on a wagon train in a previous Kalem picture, ""The Frenzy of Firewater."" The settlers have thrown their wagons into the form of a circle about the paling-enclosed blockhouse. The camera is placed on a hill so that the attack in the valley is shown in all its details. One of the features of the play is the exploding of the powder magazine, which wrecks the building and carries annihilation to the defenders of the blockhouse. Of the scenes that stand out, one of the best is where the troop of cavalry rides out to find the Indians. Their route takes them along the ridge of a long hill; riding in single file the military figures are outlined against the skyline and form an effective picture. Another scene worthy of special mention is the duel with knives between the settler Jim and the half-breed Crow. It is stirring and not revolting; it is what men will call a ""real scrap."" The cast is excellent. There is that soldier of fortune. General C. Rhys Pryce, veteran of the Boer war and officer under Madero in the late Mexican insurrection, if not in the latest one, at least in the one that succeeded up to the time this is written. General Pryce has the part of Captain Steele of the United States Cavalry. He has done previous work in pictures, but in this production he shows improvement in his appearance before the camera. He does not betray the consciousness that he did in his early characterization. Carlyle Blackwell has the role of Jim, a settler. He carries his part well. William H. West plays Jack, the other settler. This old veteran of the operatic stage as well as of the pictures has done no better screen work than he does here. Paul Hurst is most convincing as Crow, the half-breed; he has the bearing, the converted physiognomy, that make the part. Knute Rahmn gives us one of his well-known Indian portrayals as Pasac, a chief. Last, but by no means least, is the little woman who has the role of Dot, the wife of Jim, Marin Sais. There are two scenes in which she has an opportunity for the display of ability. They are particularly difficult ones, difficult in so far that it requires balanced judgment to avoid exaggeration. She has been seized by the half- breed and thrown into his tent. She is in his power. You feel the terror she displays only in her eyes. It is fine work. - The Moving Picture World, January 18, 1913",United States,George Melford,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0003052/,short,1913,

In this early movie, he is a wanted man -- for a crime his brother committed, and for which he has taken the blame. When we first meet Tom, he's gotten a job as a ranch hand for round-up. Over the course of the show, he escapes twice, falls in love with Myrtle Stedman, and performs some nice stunts, including being dragged over the ground with a foot caught in a stirrup.Mix was beginning to get a reputation by the time Selig sent him out to Arizona to shoot this, one of a series of shorts, Perhaps that explains why, while it is listed as a two-reeler, the copy I saw took just shy of 40 minutes to play out. True, the titles are far more elaborate than was common in 1913, and the film seemed to have been played a bit slower than warranted, but it takes only 16 minute to go through two reels of movie. I suspect that scenes from other movies were added to bring it up to (very short) feature length.It's a standard western plot, well shot and played.

It has been made convincing by carefulness in even small details, and the interest has been heightened by weaving a love story in as a natural part of the whole.

The work of this gifted player, who has here a part just suited to her, makes the picture a worthy offering that will be liked. The producer has been careful and discriminating; his back grounds and sets are almost perfect for the story, which he has kept perfectly clear. Bannister Merwin, the author, deserves credit for much, but surely for giving Miss Fuller such a chance. Augustus Phillips plays the artist with his customary integrity and finish. Miriam Nesbitt plays the foil; Mrs. Wallace Erskine. her mother; Mrs. Wm. Bechtel, the landlady and Messrs. H. Beaumont, Geo. Lessey and Walter Edwin plays artists.

The story is clear and chooses a significant situation, so truthfully human and worthwhile that a plain, simple development of it would have stood up well. In fact, the picture had a better ""punch"" up to the time the foreman was conventionally shown to be a coward, than it did at any time after. A man and woman had been divorced, because the man couldn't control his temper. The man had left the city and, to make a man of himself, had got a job in a mine which, later, through a legacy, becomes the property of his former wife. The man, at the works, has to see the foreman making love to her. What a chance to show that the man had now learned to govern his temper! The picture fails to do it very clearly, and loses its golden crown to rake among the dry straw of conventional melodrama.

In the next act, the officer overhears the hero persuading the paymaster not to take the money and he, at once, brings the colonel who catches the hero replacing the box of bills in the safe. So the hero is compelled to pretend he is guilty to save the girl's father. The Indians help the hero to rehabilitate himself and then we have the ending full of justice rather than of law.

Griffith's bosses at Biograph had agreed to let him make features, instead of limiting him to three reels, as they did with this movie. With its strong story of lust, pride, anger and ultimate redemption, I think Griffith might have expanded it to encompass all the seven deadly sins. As it is, he produced a typically fine melodrama with strong outdoor photography.Mae Marsh lives in the hills with her father, W. Christie Miller, and her crippled mother, Kate Bruce. Bobby Harron is sweet on her, but she likes to throw rocks at him, as well as the top-hatted and cloaked Henry B. Walthall who comes riding by one day. Walthall isn't taken aback. He gives her sauce, and talks her into coming down into the valley with her. While he is making arrangements, up comes Viola Dana, and they fight and cuddle. Miss Marsh realizes she has made a mistake, but can't go home. Instead she gets a job at a lunch room.The copy recently posted on YouTube is from a complete 16mm print of great age. The story is quite obviously far more coy than the sort of stage melodrama that Griffith had doubtless toured in before getting into the movies, but a lot of the appurtenances are there. As one would expect for this period, the story-telling is brisk, the camera lingers only for the ""beauty shots"" of Miss Marsh in the open countryside -- and beautiful they are indeed -- and Griffith's star company fills out the group shots without any fuss -- if you look for them, you can spot Lillian Gish and Lionel Barrymore, but if you don't, they're just people standing where people would naturally stand, doing things that people would naturally do.In the end, the survival of this three-reeler doesn't set new highs or lows for Griffith in this period. It's simply another fine work in a period when he was doing very fine work, and a pleasure for those of us who enjoy his work, warts and all.",United States,D.W. Griffith,D.W.

It does not exactly develop any very strong situation, calling for unusual acting, yet has the merit of presenting a number of clearly defined and likable characters. There is no question at any time what the various people are doing and what part it is they are playing. The story is simple and straightforward, telling of a young man's difficulties in winning a girl whose father objects to the match.

Later the first man reappears and some strongly emotional scenes result. Earle Williams, Darwin Karr and Clara Kimball Young have the leads and their work is very convincing.

The observer watches the opening scenes with some misgivings, but when the picture of the Madonna and child is unwrapped and its influence upon the various characters is shown, it can be seen that this story touches life in many different phases. There is an allegorical tinge to the scenes where the demi-monde begins her pilgrimage toward the light, and bringing in the scrub woman was a touch of genius.

His work is more than skillful; it is artistic. There are cohesiveness and continuity; fine costumes and settings. Above all, there is a story that will hold throughout. In the second reel there are many situations that will thrill, and they will do so by reason of the strength of the story itself, which is dramatic and in no wise spectacular. One of the scenes especially worthy of mention is of the courtroom. The trial is portrayed with unusual effectiveness. There are flashes to the judge, to the prisoner, to the jury, to the spectators, to the lawyer for the defense. Mary Alden does splendid work in her characterization of the wife who foolishly believes herself neglected. Messrs. Newton. Holmes and Hopkins also contribute to the effectiveness of the picture.

This fact that Corbett appears in the picture. and appears much, has been the justification for the makers putting out such a story. With another leading man something in the way of script would have been necessary to put over the production. Mr. Corbett himself is satisfactory, considering he is new to picture making. It will be remembered that he has had stage experience. There is a claim jumping episode, a polo game, a holdup, a bond forgery, a murder, after which we see the dripping knife; the mystery of the killing is solved by reason of the photograph of the murderer showing in the eyes of the man who was killed. Jim is sent to prison on circumstantial evidence, which of necessity must be strong, but in this case there was none in sight. There are sufficient incidents to please those who like some kinds of ""action."" By the way, why does Mr. Corbett buy so many shirts of one pattern?

It is especially true of the manicure girl, herself, played by Marjory Ellison, Mrs. C.J. Williams. Gertrude McCoy. Augustus Phillips and William Bechtel, with others, ably help. The story, by George R. Chester, without being strongly convincing as a whole, has several freshly pleasing situations. C. Jay Williams produced it in a lively way. The use of photographs in the boudoir scene is awkward; what the manicure heard was names, she didn't see pictures in that way.

He calls at her home that evening and they stroll. They also exchange photos. Four years later Marjorie marries Prince Lorenzo (Al Ernest Garcia) to satisfy her mother's social ambition, but she still loves Wilbur. Marjorie and Wilbur next meet at a naval reception in Italy. Both are unhappy. In a secluded nook they pour out their sympathy for each other, which is observed by Prince Orloff (Henry W. Otto), friend of Prince Lorenzo. Orloff notifies Lorenzo, who goes to take a look, but finds Wilbur making love to Marjorie's sister. This results in a duel between Orloff and Lorenzo, in which Lorenzo is killed. The wisdom of depicting Prince Lorenzo as a manly Italian nobleman raises the production out of the rut of cheap melodrama. Mr. Lem B. Parker, the author and producer of the picture, is to be congratulated for his persistent efforts in showing the full figure on the screen, instead of cutting everybody off at the knees. The action is just as plain, and he gets the full benefit of his beautiful scenic selections. There isn't much use for beautiful settings if close up acting obscures them all. The story is not altogether clear in spots. There is confusion as to the identity of the two princes, and the sister of Marjorie, The photography unfortunately is dark. The light seems to be from the wrong direction and throws the faces into their own shade. This kills expression. We mention it lest someone be inclined to blame Mr. Parker's use of the full length figure for the lack of facial expression. The story is good and there is fine composition in many of the scenes. - The Moving Picture World, August 16, 1913",United States,Lem B. Parker,Lem B.

There is a beautifully danced fandango in it and this helps it out as an offering. We like the acting and the scenes. It is not a great, but a serviceable picture. W.A. Corey is the author and the script was produced by Lem Parker. Harry Otto plays the priest; H.A. Lockwood, the American; E. Loveridge, the heroine, and Al. Garcia, the bandit. Gordie Colwell dances.

There is a dramatic moment when the three meet in the room of a girl with whom each is in love. In spite of the fact that there is raging a battle between the North and South, the three men fight a triangular duel, instead of two of them fulfilling the duty of soldiers and returning to their respective commands.

One will find in it the Biograph earnestness; there is, for instance, a good stiff scrap at the end that seems quite like the real thing. It uses the situation of the girl alone in the house trying to save some money from a gang of tramps. Her lover is the telegraph operator at the little railroad station, and she flashes a message across the fields in the Morse code to him with a mirror. He brings railroaders to the rescue and we have the scrap. It is told very clearly and smoothly so that it ""gets over"" and makes the audience sit up to follow it, in many cases breathlessly. Claire McDowell plays the girl; Henry Walthall, the operator; Lionel Barrymore, the girl's father, and Harry Cary, the first tramp.

It is getting pretty close to the explosion time before any one discovers that a drunken man's plot has gone wrong, and now follows the dramatic race to reach the house of the poor woman in time to save her and her children. There is some noticeable slackening in the plot's workings, due to the fact that the children carried home the clock (it was inside of the turkey) yet it seems a very long race for the man trying to save them. He rides on a motorcycle, an automobile, and he runs. Children such as were shown couldn't travel far on foot, so the race fails to convince very strongly.

In a story about a lynching? Yes indeed. Gish and Harron are, as always, wonderful in this western shot out in the west on a visit. With Gish, you watch the whole body, especially the hands.Although he directed more than 500 films of every length and description, not much Griffith is available save for four of his features and perhaps half a dozen of his shorts.

The girl is alone in the house with the thug; but the reasons for his being there are not trite, nor is the outcome of it. There is a slightly humorous touch of nature in it that is especially commendable. Walter Miller plays a man too lazy to help his wife (Lillian Gish) clean house, who sends a hired man (Charles Mailes) to take his place and himself goes fishing. The helper stops at a saloon and while he is getting drunk.

tt0003164,La mort de Saül,1912.0,4.8,7,"Drama,Short","The story of David and Saul is an interesting and ambitious choice of material, and this short feature does a creditable job of filming it. The story has plenty of action, plus some significant psychological themes, and this movie succeeds in bringing out at least some of both.One reason for the film's interest is the hand-tinted color. Much of it has now faded, unfortunately, but some of the color sequences have held up pretty well. A number of times, the movie effectively uses red, smoky tinting, both as a visual effect and in establishing an atmosphere. One of the later outdoor sequences also has a good variety of colors.The story is based on the biblical accounts of King Saul's jealousy and anger towards David, and it follows the often turbulent events that resulted. The original story, while sometimes quite violent, is actually a very interesting character study, in the contrast between David's youthful innocence and Saul's increasingly desperate, frustrated envy.In this feature, the character of Saul is the one that works the best. The acting of most or all of the cast is very demonstrative, with a lot of extravagant gestures, and this works better for a character like Saul, whose mind is falling apart more and more as the story proceeds. The portrayal of David does not work quite so effectively, since it would take more subtle gestures to bring out the most significant aspects of his personality.Despite this and some other drawbacks, the color and the interesting subject matter make this worth seeing, at least for those with a serious interest in silent movies and their historical development.",France,Henri Andréani,Eugène Creissel,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0003164/,short,1912,12

The fact that it refuses to go the whole way and be simply an out-and-out melodrama with all the impossibilities of such keeps it from getting anywhere; it doesn't prove or rightfully end anything and so itself criticizes the situation it chose. Then it is hardly probable that a bank clerk who looked as intelligent as Richard Tucker would lose ten thousand dollars in so inexcusable a way; it criticizes nearly every character concerned in the plot. It is a very well staged offering and the chief players are all that could be desired. Bessie Learn has the romantic lead opposite to Richard Tucker. Robert Brower and William West play the friendly bank presidents. There is a bookkeeper in West's bank who deserves mention, but we don't know his name.

Underneath the neighborhood scrap, caused by O'Grady's goat, who gets some of Sullivan's cherished flowers, is a love story. Sullivan's daughter and Grady's son are sweethearts, and it is chiefly to help these two that O'Hara is moved to act. The picture was ably produced by Van Dyke Brooke, who plays O'Hara.

tt0003228,Olaf-An Atom,1913.0,5.8,18,"Romance,Short","A picture that is wholly conventional; but makes good use of all its material after the rather dull opening. It is the picture of the race to the office of the land claims agent. Olaf, a tramp, is fed by the settler's wife and later finds that certain evil men have discovered a flaw in the papers of his benefactress' husband. He sends the man riding on his horse to save his claim and himself rides on the trunk- rack behind their automobile, cutting the tires with a knife. It lacks the sentimental ending, which is one thing to be thankful for. The camera work is fair. The players, Claire McDowell, Charles Mailes and Harry Carey (Olaf) do pretty well; the picture gave them small chance to act. - The Moving Picture World, May 31, 1913",United States,Anthony O'Sullivan,William E.

""After this is silence."" The picture makes the drama ""Richelieu,"" and, even in this, the quotation is not very much out of place; but we think that the story was better as first told. This old actor is played well by Frank Clark and he is ably supported by Bessie Eyton, H.W. Otto, T. Santschi and W. Hutchinson.

It is also well developed, too, but perhaps the promise was better than the fulfillment. The two women, one the wife and the other the inamorata of the man, are at the same beach hotel and have become friends since neither suspects. The husband doesn't know that the actress is at that hotel and he is coming to visit his wife, who has their little daughter with her. Coming out on the beach, he finds the child distressed because her mother, out swimming, has called for help. The man is just in time to help the other woman carry the almost drowned wife out of the water. The last scene shows the actress back in the city, lonesome but proudly destroying the man's portrait, while the man is happy with his family. The staging is very careful and the picture is a good offering. Written by Lillian Sweetser, it was produced by Van Dyke Brooke.

tt0003254,"Pauline Cushman, the Federal Spy",1913.0,,,"Drama,Short","The most carefully prepared scenario will fail without talented production. Director Oscar Eagle has excelled all his former efforts in this fine war drama. Mr. Eagle has handled the large masses of men in the opposing armies with great skill and effectiveness. There is no sign of the ""tin'' soldier here. The men were crack companies from the Illinois National Guard infantry, and troopers from the same source. The batteries were composed of ten pieces of artillery, and they were handled in the production with the skill and dash of veteran service. Indeed, the evolutions of the men, and the fine soldierly bearing of the officers throughout, impress us with all the realism of grim war itself. The selection of Miss Winnifred Greenwood, leading woman of Selig's Eastern stock company, for the titular role was very happy, in more ways than one. In the first place. Miss Greenwood absolutely loses herself in Pauline Cushman. One is fascinated by her daring, her coolness amid danger, and the swiftness and cautiousness of her movements. Not once is there displayed a sign of self-consciousness. That interview with the Confederate officers, in the hotel lobby, Louisville, is just as natural as if the Union spy herself were present. The scene in Wood's theater. Louisville, where Pauline toasts the Confederacy, and throws the dregs in her wine glass on the Stars and Stripes, is positively thrilling. And here, by the way, Director Eagle is given a hearty hand-shake for a magnificent interior scene, which shows most of the audience seated in the theater and also a good view of the stage. The excitement following the toast shows up finely on the screen, as the spirited contest on the stage between Copperheads and loyal Unionists is the real thing, and has been excellently worked up. Miss Greenwood looks well on horseback, and her dashing ""get- aways"" in the saddle, as Pauline Cushman, are full of spirit and create, enthusiasm. Good photography marks the production, which consists of two reels. – The Moving Picture World, March 22, 1913",United States,Oscar Eagle,Charles E.

The film provides a showcase for perfect performances by the leads, with Walter Miller a standout as the shy would-be suitor. Despite the occasionally far-fetched story elements, this film shows the kind of entertainment that was wildly popular in its time, and gives us a glimpse of some long-gone outdoor scenery.

tt0003269,A Perilous Cargo,1913.0,,,"Drama,Short","A not very effectively made melodramatic picture, fabricated to use an old hulk of a ship, high and dry on the rocks, which at the climax is shattered by dynamite. If the story gives excitement, and it does at certain moments, it is by contagion, not by suggestion; by the running about and gesticulating of the players, and never by the convincing development of a dramatic situation. The fact that too many things in it give the producer's expedients away makes it seem very artificial. We had to see it with three audiences; in one it was laughed at; in the others, while there were some who seemed to be watching closely, some plainly didn't. The producer had two ships, and they were not enough alike. We can't praise the writer of the script, either; but we cannot pass without praising the players; it is remarkable that they accomplished so much. Walter Edwin and Herbert Prior, but especially the former, who has the lead, do fine work. John Sturgeon, as the lighthouse keeper, and Edna Flugrath. as his daughter, also do well. William Bechtel and Richard Ridgely. the conspirators, had ungrateful roles and seemed a bit too melodramatic; they had to do something.

Not a pleasant picture, but very strongly presented and one that should do much to awaken public conscience and the attention of railway officials.

tt0003274,Phantoms,1913.0,,,"Drama,Romance,Short","A good, strong offering. It is a freshly interesting, psychological study of theatrical people; but especially of one actress who, and this is most unusual in stories or in pictures, is convincingly made to seem, by her mental make-up and her whole experience, to be a true genius. It is she who sees the ""phantoms"" and who, at the end, falls into a beatific insanity in which her whole life is phantoms. This fate is dramatically effective, as it is made to come to her through a door left open in her own character. Her flighty impetuousness makes the situation by making her write a crazy letter to her lover; she was jealous of the time he gave to his dying mother. So her romance is nipped and. in spite of her brilliant success as an actress, it preys on her mind until she goes mad The concomitant human things needed to make it a story and give it a habitation in real life are not wanting and we commend the picture as a desirable offering to the public. This leading character and the stage director are finely acted; but every character m the picture has been made life-like and interesting in themselves. W.E.

In its showing of Indian character, it gets over very well, although that carrying of the Indian heroine by her white lover made some uncomplimentary laughter. Such incidents are only for the gallery. William West is commendable as the Indian chief and Francellia Billington is most engaging as his daughter. - The Moving Picture World, February 15, 1913",United States,George Melford,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0003292/,short,1913,

tt0003296,The Prince of Evil,1913.0,,,"Drama,Short","Here is a great story, portrayed in a manner that will make the picture remembered by all who see it. There are two reels of straight drama, not a line of comedy in it. It would be difficult to overpraise the acting of those who make this picture, for it is in the interpretation of the script that the chief distinction of this film lies. There are five persons who do the brunt of the work. They are L. Rogers Lytton, Edith Storey, E.K. Lincoln, Harry Northrup and Anita Stewart, The second reel is a succession of big situations. The climax, where Miss Storey goes to her married sister, Miss Stewart, and, unaware that her brother-in-law, Mr, Northrup, is present in the room, asks how ""it is all going to end,"" is one of unusual power. The appeal of the gambling but otherwise innocent wife for the forgiveness of her husband is a dramatic gem. The thought would not, will not, down. What possibilities there are in this play and with this cast for the stage? No man or woman concerned with the art of dramatic expression should miss seeing ""A Prince of Evil."" - The Moving Picture World, August 9, 1913",United States,Ralph Ince,Marguerite Bertsch,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0003296/,short,1913,

The other man comes out to demand that she keep her bargain with him and it is made to look as though he were going to make trouble. All he wants is the cash in the safe which he makes the woman open for him. There is a struggle scene and then a chase scene with the husband coming in at the climax to save both the woman and the money.

tt0003322,The Redemption,1913.0,,,"Drama,Short","A picture in two parts with a sociological interest. It stands as a story rather than as a study and entertains even though we may feel that the optimistic teaching behind it is not wholly justified. The suspense is carried through both reels and keeps one from noticing the passage of time. Wm. H. West plays the philanthropist who, by his human treatment of a burglar (Carlyle Blackwell), converts him. His optimism is strained almost to the breaking point, but the result convinces even the unbeliever, at least while he is watching, and gets him deeply interested. .Mr. Blackwell didn't look much like a rough (there was more of the conventional underworld in his pals, Jane Wolf and Paul Hurst) but he carries the action clearly. Miss Wolf puts good atmosphere into her part. Those who have seen her in such roles as hers in ""The Flower Girl's Romance"" know what she is capable of doing in a truly human situation. Knute Rahm, as the skeptical friend of the philanthropist, does well, as does Marin Sais as his wife.

They tell them they are members of the 13th Regiment, and bring their daughter's boyfriend, E. K. Lincoln, in on the story; he is a member of the regiment. As officers, they must turn out for duties once a week, and they spend it in a night on the town. Eventually, the 13th is ordered to Cuba, and they take the opportunity to go on a fishing trip. Then comes word that the 13th has been wiped out in battle.There's a great deal going on in this movie. There's a leaky pipe that explodes one evening, drenching everyone in a slapstick performance. There are the little bits of stage business that Drew performs, that would make him one of the best actors in silent comedy. But there are secondary characters, like Josie Sadler as the cook, with her own boyfriend and a long-lost brother to fill up the gaps and keep the audience occupied, as well as Anita Stewart as Morey's wife. Vitagraph was dabbling in longer movies at this time. Like most longer American movies, the majority of them were not particularly good, because their screenwriters seemed incapable of merging subplots that fit into the narrative. With this movie being the story of two allied households, scenarist Anthony Wills managed that pretty well, and left the comedy sequences as highlights for the two older gentlemen.

The adapter has done his work commendably, except matters might have been one or two more subfiles. The costumes are accurate and the staging, though rather Italian than German, is sumptuous. The chief value of it, as an offering, comes from the fact that it is a picture of a classical play, seldom or never seen now, but often talked of and lectured on.

The scenes are handled smoothly and convincingly and, with one or two exceptions, the players do very good work indeed. But it has one drawback as a whole: it is more interested in giving us sensations than it is in building up in us the big sensation from the dangers and perplexities of the heroine. In order to enjoy any picture of a struggle we have got to take sides, and there is no way to make us get so wrapped up in one as to make the fate of beauty in distress hang on the outcome of the fight, or chase, or struggle-of-wits. This picture's heroine had been in deep danger, but she has been practically rescued, and still the story keeps on; we see a fight on top of a swiftly moving train, but have almost forgotten what it is about. The heroine was got out of the villain's house too soon. Fraunie Fraunholtz makes the leading role very interesting with his evil plotting and villainous demeanor, though once or twice it was overdone, as when he threw the table down. Vinnie Burns plays a piteous figure as the heroine and deserves praise. The detective is the picture's weakest point in scenario and in the acting, though that disguise was most ably accomplished. On the whole, we believe the offering will be liked. - The Moving Picture World, November 15, 1913",United States,Alice Guy,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0003339/,short,1913,40

The actuality of all these things and the natural acting of the players who, being of Seville, are to the manner born, make it tremendously effective. There are elements of excitement that heighten the impression it makes. The marked enthusiasm of the throngs on bullfight day is one of these, and especially of the spectators during the fight. We can't deny that a bullfight is a brutal form of sport, but this picture of one didn't offend us at all. There is a horse killed, but it is not done brutally to make a picture.

tt0003355,Saved by the Pony Express,1911.0,5.6,29,"Short,Western","When the faces and individualities of the players in a moving picture are obscured by shadows, there is often much confusion in the spectator's mind. Because the faces in the first two or three scenes of this picture could not be clearly distinguished by this reviewer, he wasn't sure which of the two men who quarreled in the hut was the more acceptable to the girl on horseback whom it was plain both loved. The producer of the picture seems to have depended for interest largely on the bare dramatic struggle, the ride against time of the pony express rider to bring to the court the evidence that the hero is innocent. He has not shown us this hero in any significant action; we do not know what kind of a man he is. The jury believes that he shot the man who accidentally killed himself. This well-photographed jury of twelve good and true Westerners seems to have been very well chosen. They all look prosperous. Two are quick to take offense in an argument and are as quick to make up when they see their mistake. The pony express man rides remarkably well; he knows horses, wild and tame, and his ride with the dead man's last letter, ends in an exciting jump, horse and all, into the court room. One may ask whether juries in the West are apt to be formal. This jury had to retire again before it could change its verdict.

tt0003357,A Sawmill Hazard,1913.0,,,"Drama,Short,Thriller","There is a good, interesting situation in this melodrama which works up, if ""up"" is the right word, to the sawmill climax with the unconscious hero placed on the log carrier by the villain to be rescued by the heroine. We know well by observation that the old trick is still effective in many places; it's an incident that a certain class of people still like. We have seen it applauded even when very crudely done and here it is well done. We saw it with a Broadway audience which laughed at the crude, most melodramatic acting of the villain; but which was silent at the end. He blocks the action right out with no desire for that shading that tries to give the impression of real life. Alice Hollister is the heroine; Earle Fox, the hero; Helen Lindroth, the boy's mother and R.G. Vignola, the villain. These are all good players. Even in such a story they plainly show their skill and because of this, when allowance is made for their, as some think, necessary playing up to melodramatic parts, it makes a fair offering. There is some good photography in it and some interesting scenes. - The Moving Picture World, January 25, 1913",United States,J.P. McGowan,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0003357/,short,1913,28

They are on the vaudeville stage and the same man pays attention to one of them much to the other's distress. Later, she finds that he is the man they are seeking and, after a series of scenes not without merit as entertainment, the man, dying from a wound given by the older sister, begs forgiveness. The chase of one sister by the man's groom over the city; and the old-world, mysterious hidden rooms and hidden secret stairs of the man's castle through which the other sister chases him are the picture's best parts.

tt0003384,The Snare,1912.0,,,"Drama,Short","The part that a spy plays in war and the part that a detective plays in the closely analogous situation in social life have much in common. The work that both do is necessary and worthy of high praise when done in the right spirit; but the means used, under other circumstances, would seem contemptible. When one sees, in any picture, a pretty lady detective brazenly winning the confidence of a criminal's old mother solely to betray it, he has to do some deep thinking in a hurry before he can wholly sympathize with it; he has greatly to despise the criminal before the sympathy will come. If he doesn't sympathize with it, he has to condone the criminal, which is revolting to the normal mind. To picture the lady detective at work compels the normal mind to sympathize with her. If the producer's object is to picture the turmoil in a young detective's heart, doing her harsh work for the first time, he can safely picture her as revolting at the means she uses and whatever comes of it, we, at least, have a wholesome picture. The producer of ""The Snare"" hasn't centered his interest in the detective's heart nor does he permit us to sympathize with the criminal, for we don't know that he is not guilty and surely the detective thinks him guilty since he is in hiding. He makes the lady revolt from her business and help the criminal and then begs the question by proving the man innocent. It is a picture that asks our sympathy, but leaves us no one to sympathize with, and though well produced and cleverly acted it is not a strong offering. Lily Branscombe plays the old mother; Wm. Bailey, her son; Beverly Bayne, the lady on the case; Frank Dayton. E.H. Calvert, Chas. Hitchcock and Wm. Mason are detectives. Howard Missimer is the telegraph operator who brings the news that the man is not guilty, and Whitney Raymond is the boy in the detective agency. - The Moving Picture World, November 2, 1912",United States,Theodore Wharton,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0003384/,short,1912,

Later, when he is financially ruined, he steals some jewels at a reception. This was the weakest scene in the production, as the open, unguarded jewel cases would hardly have been left as they were. The picture ends happily, the young wife awakening after the husband is arrested. She pleads for his release and succeeds in obtaining it.

The story lacks dramatic quality, but it gives a well utilized chance of making thrilling, emotional scenes and the offering, as a whole, will be warmly received at this time, when war anniversaries are stirring old memories.

The acting is competent, although the cameraman seemed to be a bit off the best speed in taking the scene in which the older man accuses the girl whom he has now married, of loving the son. The letter she writes is convincing, but the son's tearing of it to deceive the father, and the ease with which this is accomplished, are not strongly so. In drama, the deaths of all concerned is not the strongest way of making the situation powerful, as it really denies emotion.

It was necessary to have this character grip the hearts of the audience in order to make the story truly dramatic, and it fails to do this. All others in the picture are kept in the background, are mere figures. We have first the fast club man whom the woman loves, or thinks she does and with whom she is going to the devil. Then, most pleasingly suggested, comes the woman's awakening. In this touch there is a sincerity that does the authoress much credit and shows that she knows how to write for the people, even if she doesn't always. Then we have the other, the good man, who is quite flat, and then the unimaginative ending. Van Dyke Brooke produced it.

We are not sure that the American really loves the girl and most spectators will feel that he was too self-confident in handing out his photograph when he did, and also that he was too simple to make a good lover when they see him buying so many parrots and taking them home to the hotel.

Ford Sterling here is perfect in his role; so are Mack and Mabel.

They set up the old home again to entertain her. She expects to stay but a few hours, then loses her train and decides to remain all night. The theme is most delicately treated; but the picture lacks vigor, is even slow. It is an offering of lovely scenes and beautiful poses more than of human passion or fates. Sydney Drew plays convincingly the man, with Anita Stewart in the role opposite to him, a part that seemed to us a bit beyond her depth at present. It is a role that calls for experience and when Miss Stewart has had a chance to watch the world a few years longer, she will have the skill to play such situations with much power. Mrs. Maurice plays the mother. The man's valet deserves notice; in fact, there is much to commend in many of the lesser figures. The photography is good.

Director Mack adds to the titillation by discretely undressing Ms. Weisse a couple of times, which was a bit of surprise but would certainly have been appreciated by fans of the forbidden dance back in the day. While I'm no connoisseur, the dancing seems a little stiff and would be surpassed in later film treatments it does entertain, particularly given the restrictions on the pre-War frocks the ladies were confined to at the time.

The starting point seems to be in some original moral reflection, or impression might be better; for, while concrete, it is fluid enough not to hamper the dramatist in giving a pictorial expression to it. If one analyzes this story he will find it as deep as life; it will elude him in its meaning, even though he know more about it than the producer or author. It gives a tantalizing glimpse of humanity passing through a queer world; ours is a queer world. The tender-hearted boy hasn't had experience and finds that human wisdom is a very necessary virtue, for without it he finds that his kindliness is like a child in a winter storm without a house to shelter it. In this life, if one has anything precious, he must have a strong box to keep it in. Suggestive as the picture is, it isn't very brave, for it is made interesting to the many, though this, from the exhibitor's viewpoint, is a big merit.

tt0003450,The Thirteenth Man,1913.0,,,"Drama,Short","I love when this happens. In case you don't know, I've watched a lot of old silent films over the years. Inevitably, when dealing with such obscure relics, one finds connections to which they haven't seen anyone else (re)discover yet (which isn't to say someone(s) hasn't). Anyways, here's one, a surviving fragment (five minutes pushed to eight with the addition of explanatory title cards based on its description in the ""Moving Picture World"") of an Essanay one-reeler starring would-be 1910s matinee idol Francis X. Bushman, ""The Thirteenth Man,"" as seen on the new Flicker Alley Blu-ray. My discovery being that even in its fragmentary form today, it struck me as reminiscent of another rarely-seen silent short that I'd seen before. Turns out it was an Alice Guy Solax production, ""The Thief,"" released the same year, 1913, as this title. How ironic, then, that these films are about a small jewel being believed to be stolen. Turns out nothing was stolen in the films, but that's the happy ending of the flickers for you, because, indeed, something was stolen: the scenario itself.The other and sad irony is that time and neglect have stolen footage from this sole known print of ""The Thirteenth Man."" A truly unlucky number, it turns out, although most silent films now no longer exist at all.As for the search for the scenario thief, though, that's seemingly easy enough to figure out, but, first, let's examine the pictures. When I saw Guy's film months ago, when completing during Women's History Month my viewing of all her available films I could find (mostly via home video from Kino Lorber), I wasn't impressed enough to even write a review for ""The Thief,"" as the world's first female filmmaker made many better films than it (here's my list of some of them), but her more complete version is better than this one. In it, the scenario springs from two old men looking through a yearbook and with their nostalgic remembrances superimposed above them, whereas ""The Thirteen Man"" skips a year during its plot in lieu of a vision flashback. Additionally, the sets are more ornate, there's some trick photography for a lighting change (when the jewel is lost), some crosscutting between scenes if not shots, as well as an insert close-up, as in the Essanay version, when the jewel is found.In both pictures, though, a group of rich guys get together for a reunion dinner, except one of the invitees has since fallen on hard times (Bushman's role here)--living in poverty with a wife and child. The jewel goes missing during the dinner, and the poor man is humiliated in the subsequent search, which he refuses of his self, for the suspected stolen item. The rich guy follows the poor man home to discover that the only items he stole were food from the dinner to provide for his hungry family. Rich guy makes amends, the end.As to who stole who's scenario, Essanay or Solax, checking the release dates would seemingly provide the answer. ""The Thirteenth Man"" premiered on January 21st, whereas the aptly-titled ""The Thief"" didn't do likewise until February 14th. Aha!, you may say--even though an earlier release date doesn't necessarily indicate which scenario was the original, especially when the release dates and, thus, presumably the productions were so close. Regardless, in a classic twist, I decided to check back on the entries for ""The Thirteenth Man"" in the ""Moving Picture World"" magazine. Beyond the scenario description, I found a contemporary review:""This very same story was produced by the Imp company a year ago and more, and, if we remember rightly, it did it more skillfully. It is not a very strong picture"" (Jan-Mar 1913, vol. 15, p. 571).Ouch, although the brief review does end by claiming, ""The photography is good."" So, they're both thieves and, perhaps, this unknown Imp film is the true victim! Perhaps. Even if I could find this Imp, however, it may, too, have been itself--I'll just say it--impish. As Guy biographer Allison McMahan (author of the book ""Alice Guy Blaché: Lost Visionary of the Cinema"") says:""The plot of 'The Thief' was a common one, and many of the other film companies produced films with very similar themes at the time, although more often than not the person suspected of thievery was an innocent young working woman"" (p. 130).So true--I seem to faintly recall having seen a few of those, although I don't remember any with the blatantly cribbed scenarios of these culprits. And, I don't mean to harp too much on incriminating Solax or Essanay, the latter for which the Museum today of dedicated to the silent film studio helped in restoring this film, among other wonderful things. Indeed, just about every studio back then ripped off scenarios from other studios, albeit some (ahem, Lubin) more prolifically than others. Guy, for one, had her scenarios stolen frequently, particularly by Pathé when she ran Gaumont, and, in turn, she started out reworking Lumière films. And, as for those so-called inventors of film--although the history of the invention of movies is more complicated than that, but whatever, the point is--Edison and Lumière remade others' scenarios, too. From the beginning, Edison seems to have cribbed the Zoetrope motion picture sketches of Ottomar Anschütz (such as for the early barbershop scene) and long before the Edison studio routinely ripped off rival AM&B and everything from England and France, and Lumière included a remake of an Edison film (the blacksmith scene) in its famous first public projections.

This was but a form of special privilege, ah old world, undemocratic practice, that soon incensed the common people who had to pay the price.

The raiders have set the toll house on fire and by chance, not only the keeper's daughter but the daughter of the road's chief owner is in danger and both are rescued from the flames by a young lawyer.

One of its scenes that will surely attract attention pictures a chase of two runaway slaves. The heroine (and this incident goes very well in a love story of the time and place) has slipped out of her home to visit the lover whom her father dislikes with reason and, with her darkie mammy, is crossing the fields. The chase is approaching. She has coal black on her face and the lover thinks that she is a mulatto. His treatment of her quite disgusts her with him and opens the way for the man whom her father likes. This incident is handled in a very competent way; it is made clear and most effective. Marian Cooper plays the Southern girl; Guy Coombs the adventurer who wants to get her money and who fires the treacherous shot which nearly kills her true lover, played by Hal Clements. The girl's father is played by Henry Hallem. A very good offering. - The Moving Picture World, January 18, 1913",United States,Kenean Buel,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0003476/,short,1913,

He returns home and sends a young man on an expedition for the island treasure. He and his party find the girl, but do not learn that she constitutes the entire treasure until the professor arrives and tells them so. This story is extremely romantic and beautifully pictured, but it leaves much to the imagination and it struck us the ending was a little flat, for everyone on the expedition, except the young man, who, of course, gets the girl. Charles Kent and Anita Stuart play the old professor and the girl, and E.K.

The story is of an artist who is given a commission to paint a portrait from a photograph and falls in love with a woman he has not seen. Later he accepts an invitation to spend a vacation with an old friend. His hostess is the original of the photograph that has so obsessed him. The husband accidentally finds the picture in the artist's suitcase. A combination of circumstances leads the husband to doubt his wife. The dialogue between the enraged husband and the innocent wife is splendidly done. The husband sees the light when he comes upon the crazed artist making love to his wife and sees her spurn him. He is in the position of a man who can't apologize; he can only try to. This drama was written and produced by Lem B.

It is an eighteen minute short in which heart and feeling abound in this old-fashioned story of a city slicker and a country farm girl and their tragic romance. Viola (Norma Talmadge) is picking flowers in a field adjacent to her Dad's farm. Along comes big city drama critic (Harry Northup) driving along and has lost his way. He alights from his car and strikes up a conversation with Viola. They are both smitten. He persuades her to leave her farm and come to the city with him.All downhill for Viola from hereon, as he tires of her, but she has fallen in love. He ignores her one evening and walks out. Disillusioned, she packs and goes back home, gets as far as the field of flowers, and sits down to write a poem describing her ill-fated love affair, after which she collapses and dies, presumably of a broken heart. A sheet of it blows toward the road and is picked up by a struggling playwright (Leo Delaney) who is taken by its bittersweet tone, finds Viola's body and the rest of the poem. He is inspired and decides to turn it into a play, which becomes a hit and is seen by the drama critic. The critic's conscience is wracked as he sees it parallels his own affair with Viola, and we leave him in a state of remorse.It is very well done and with a lot of humanity in its short run time, although it may not fit the tenor of our times and not for all tastes. It was restored by The Library of Congress as best as they could, as it is old and has many scenes barely visible due to deterioration and burn marks on the film. I didn't realize it was Norma Talmadge until the film was over and she was outstanding - I always thought she was a comedienne.

The human characters convince with power, except toward the end, where they become plot-ridden and unlikely, and the worst of it is, the plot gave plenty of natural possibilities, if the author had cared to seek for them. It was not natural nor necessary to make the bridegroom take his wounded sister home to the empty cabin rather than to the house of his sweetheart, where all the folks were, his and hers. Then the mind notices a lack in not finding a minister at the girl's house to do the marrying. As the plot now is, it would have been awkward to have had one there, but one might have been used to good advantage in a more natural plot. Would it not have been like life to have had the old man. since the bridegroom was lingering, slip out with his gun to see why? Then the younger brother might have caught a glimpse of him just before the little sister approached; might have had some reason to fire into the bushes. The people at the girl's house would have heard the shot and been full of consternation. The bridegroom and the old man would have heard the shot and would have crept near to see cautiously. The boy, thinking that he had killed his sister, would have slipped away as soon as he saw his brother coming, and the bridegroom and the old man would have met at the unconscious girl. This situation would certainly be dramatically effective and it would not be hard to develop it further. As an offering, the picture is good. It is splendidly acted by everyone in it. The producer deserves great credit. It is clearly photographed. - The Moving Picture World, August 16, 1913",United States,Kenean Buel,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0003509/,short,1913,

The shortcoming of all such picture representations is that the camera is almost sure to catch the actor off guard, and this makes the character seem artificial.

Stepdaughter of a scoundrel, she is being compelled to help in his badger work by decoying intended victims. This girl is played by Lillian Gish and she walks gracefully through the part. When the badger aims at fleecing a rich young man (Henry Walthall), her disgust at the business which had been coming to a head compels her to rebel. The villain, Charles Mailes, has enough control of her to make a dramatic climax; but it is not convincing and so not very effective. - The Moving Picture World, September 20, 1913",United States,Dell Henderson,William E.

The other half shows a time of courtesy, seventy years ago on election day; but no poor voters are shown and the town meeting can adjourn, after voting, to dance the minuet. It is not a very sincere picture in either half. Written and produced by Lem Parker, it has been gracefully played with Kathlyn Williams, Harold Lockwood, Eugenie Eesserer and A. Ernest Garcia in the leading roles. The first two are the lovers and Miss Besserer's old grandmother is astonishingly real.

Vacation land in this instance seems to be the upper parts of the beautiful Delaware River, where it is only a mountain stream. Miss Gertrude Robinson plays the wood nymph, Mr. Heckodion plays the angler, not wholly unattached; for at the time he is carrying home the wood nymph, who has sprained her ankle, he is keeping a wedding party, his own, waiting in the hotel parlor. The bride-to-be gets peevish and hurries away to the city. The angler, when he finds this out, goes back to his wood nymph. It is a pretty picture, and, while not strongly probable, it has plenty of convincing atmosphere and is a success. Views of the lovely river will be found in it.

In it are a modern Adam and Eve, portrayed by Mary Fuller, author of the story, and Harry Beaumont. It is just a pretty little love story. The girl had never seen any man, except her father, until Adam came along, having purchased the adjoining timber lot. She naively tells him he doesn't look like her father, but she loves him just the same. Pleasing comedy of the better sort, which leaves a good impression with the audience. - The Moving Picture World, November 15, 1913",United States,Walter Edwin,Mary Fuller,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0003573/,short,1913,
tt0003574,The Wordless Message,1913.0,,,"Drama,Short","A Decoration Day love story that makes no appeal to patriotism and that, showing men in blue coats with the G.A.R. badges on, has little to do with them as such. The young people, or rather the girl, is the center of interest. The opening of the picture's love story is very poor; a city man comes prowling around the porch and the girl runs away with him to be deserted. On Decoration Day she goes to a picture show and sees her father faint during a parade while it was being filmed. That is the wordless message. Colin Campbell produced it from Hettie Gray Baker's script. The photography has little art except now and then. There is one lovely picture of Bessie Eyton at her sewing machine after she has been deserted. Thomas Santschi plays a village blacksmith and Wheeler Oakman is the city youth with whom the heroine runs away. - The Moving Picture World, June 14, 1913",United States,Colin Campbell,Hettie Grey Baker,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0003574/,short,1913,
tt0003575,The Worker,1913.0,,,"Drama,Short","This three-reel melodrama produced by Will Davis has some strong scenes, well made. The first reel successfully establishes the atmosphere of the factory, of the workers and of their employer. There is some good acting by the members of the cast. There is a tendency perhaps on the part of the woman playing the stepdaughter to overact at times, but it is a heavy role she sustains. There are three whose work stands out. There are Jack Hopkins, who plays the son of the employer; Stewart Holmes, the worker, and Mary Alden, his wife. In the minor parts of factory workers there will be noted excellent character acting. The interest is well sustained. In the final reel there are good situations, with a thrill in some of them. - The Moving Picture World, September 13, 1913",United States,Will S.

tt0003576,The Wreck,1913.0,,,Drama,"A three part picture with an entirely real head-on collision between an engine and a train as its climax. The story is not as strong as it might be. but serves its purpose. Harry Morey plays the leading part with remarkable vigor and is pretty well supported. The producer has done his work well; but that scene in which the drowned boy's father is permitted to get into the room where the body is laid out without seeing any crape on the outside door is not strong. - The Moving Picture World, December 20, 1913",United States,Ralph Ince,Marguerite Bertsch,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0003576/,movie,1913,48
tt0003577,The Wrong Bottle,1913.0,,,"Drama,Short","We find in this picture the usual good quality in the acting of the players, with perhaps one exception, but not quite the usual grip on the emotions that is found in Biographs. It fails of being tense chiefly because of the obviousness of the means used to retard the danger side of the picture until the rescue side can catch up with it. Of course we don't know how it is to end, but we think we do, and the result in our emotions is the same. The photography is excellent. Clair McDowell plays a blind girl who has to take medicine. There is a bottle of poisonous antiseptic near that looks like it. Hector Dion plays a man in love with the blind girl's younger sister; but she elopes with Harry Carey and accidentally takes the medicine, leaving the poison which the blind girl's father, Lional Barrymore, thoughtlessly pours for her. - The Moving Picture World, March 22, 1913",United States,Anthony O'Sullivan,Leon J.

tt0003578,The Yaqui Cur,1913.0,6.8,21,"Short,Western","There are battle scenes in these two reels that are unusual. In fact, the picture may best be described as a big Biograph. The theme is of a young Indian who meets white men and likes their ways. He is taught to smoke cigarettes. He is given a Bible. He is told that the ways of peace are the right ways. When war breaks out between his tribe and another he refuses to fight and is cast out. Later he smilingly sacrifices his life to save that of the lover of the woman he loved and lost. He puts into practice a precept he found in the Book: ""Greater love than this."" There are many dramatic situations, relieved at times by those lighter touches so characteristic of the direction of Mr. Griffith. Robert Herron plays the Yaqui cur, and plays it well. Victoria Forde, well known to Universal followers, has the role of the Indian girl who rejects him. There are many fine photographic effects. - The Moving Picture World, May 31, 1913",United States,D.W. Griffith,Stanner E.V. Taylor,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0003578/,short,1913,33

There are pretty scenes, artistically photographed and it will make a good offering. Kathlyn Williams plays the titular role a young widow with a daughter away at boarding school. A youth falls in love with her proposes and is accepted. Later he meets the daughter and falls in love with her. A great deal depends on the acting of such a story as this, and in her part, the leading woman does very well indeed. She is supported by a cast of good players; but the young woman who played the juvenile role showed lack of experience in one or two places. The whole is commendable and will please. - The Moving Picture World, October 4, 1913",United States,Francis J. Grandon,Kathlyn Williams,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0003579/,short,1913,

It's not the strongest of Keystones, but it contains all the usual bits of humor typical of the shorts.Louise Fazenda usually played country hicks for Sennett and her comedy shorts.

This 'short' features popular silent film star, Wallace Reid, in an early role quite different from the good-guy heroes he later played. Here he plays a good-for-nothing type who is only after a woman's money, but when her rich aunt realizes his true intentions, she forces her niece to end their relationship. Reid then goes off to The Philippines during which time the rich aunt dies and, still unaware of his true nature, the wealthy niece follows her old lover overseas. His scheming ways take a turn for the worse, however, and I thought Wallace Reid played 'the bad guy' superbly. It's a good little story packed into just under 15 minutes of great drama, and is directed by Donald Crisp, who also became a successful actor in later years. For a good example of short silent films before feature-length films became popular, or a look at Wallace Reid's fine acting talents, AT DAWN is an excellent choice.",United States,Donald Crisp,Hal Reid,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0003638/,short,1914,

There were many situation comedies, and few were as deservedly popular as the Mr. & Mrs. Sidney Drew comedies, first from Vitagraph and later from their own company. Their comedies were well-written films which made fun of the foibles of the middle class, often written by Mrs. Drew and endlessly ornamented by Mr. Drew's fine stage business. He was an elder member of the Drew-Barrymore clan, an uncle of Lionel, Ethel and John.In this one, Mr. Drew's highly amusing reactions to his aunt -- the type of woman who is referred to in my family as ""strong-willed"" -- reminds me of how I used to feel about certain elderly relatives.Because of their age, not many of these comedies survive.Those which do are frequently in poor condition.

tt0003659,The Barrier of Ignorance,1914.0,,,"Drama,Short","In the incidents that the development of the story brings out there is a good deal of freshness and many a good chance for acting. The leading roles are played by Paul Hurst (unlettered mountaineer), and Marin Sais (his wife) on one side, with George H. Melford (rich doctor) and Jane Wolfe (his sister) who by some villianous work manages to keep him from marrying Marin on the other side. All these play the climaxes well; but all, with the single exception of Jane Wolfe, are conventional at times and even mechanical now and then. One might safely doubt the naturalness of that scene in which the doctor brings the barefooted and rather unkept mountain girl home to introduce to his proud sister as his acknowledged sweetheart; but no one will so surely doubt the truth of the feelings in all three as the ambitious sister turns from her in proud contempt. Least of all will he doubt the feelings that the sister expresses. Miss Wolfe plays this sister as a true type; the spectator will hardly count her as a villainess, the more because the love interest is not quite true enough to make us wholly sympathize with the doctor in his falling in love. The ambitious sister persuades the girl that his career will be ruined if he marries her, a stock situation. Yet there is good stuff in the interview that Jane has with Marin, and more good acting in the scene at the old tree when Marin gives back the ring and again in the scene at the cabin door when she makes good her purpose by taking as her lover the mountaineer who also loves her while the doctor stands by and sees it all. At this point, the doctor would naturally have passed out of the girl's life, but she and her mountaineer husband have a daughter, played by Cleo Ridgeley who was not so long ago popular in Rex pictures and who, many will remember, more recently took a horseback ride across the continent with her husband. And this girl, in a not wholly convincing incident, is the means of bringing the doctor into the story again to perform a surgical operation that saves the life of the mountaineer's wife. Yet this brings about one of the freshest and most interesting minor situations in the picture. Te wife and mother has been accidentally wounded when trying to protect her daughter who is running away from the father who won't let her learn to read, in the protection of a circuit rider, she comes to the doctor and this brings him back to save the woman's life in spite of the violent opposition of both husband and an ignorant country doctor. The photography is clear and has a pleasing tone. Yet, although it isn't really significant or true, it is secondary; the picture's main theme stands as its chief asset and gives it value enough to make the whole safely commendable to exhibitors as an offering. Perhaps, if it had been condensed to a single reel, it would have been even more commendable. - The Moving Picture World, May 23, 1914",United States,George Melford,Katherine K.

That's the only reason I can think of as to why the Edison Studio, which a couple of years earlier had been producing the most nearly title-free movies in the business, with its own style of editing, was now producing a movie like this, in which there is little in the way of telling a story by acting or moving a camera. Title after title could have been removed from the screen, replaced by a more revealing angle, but no one seemed to have thought of it. I had hoped to gain a glimpse of Harry Beaumont, who became a great director for MGM, but he is credited as one of three aides to the tyrannical English general; I have no idea which one he is.

tt0003818,The Dance of Death,1914.0,,,"Drama,Short","The possibilities for photodrama that lie in semi-tropical Florida when they are worked out by a skillful director are demonstrated in ""The Dance of Death,"" a dramatically strong two-reel Kalem production to be released on April 27th. It is a story of the South Sea Islands written by Phil Lang, the head of Kalem's scenario department, and produced by Robert G, Vignola. Mr. Vignola uses jungle a-plenty in his backgrounds. Undoubtedly he has been materially aided by the advice as his production has been enhanced by the participation in of Verna Mersereau, a charming, lithe and shapely dancer, who is said to bring to the picture first-hand knowledge of the customs and habits of the natives of the South Seas. Miss Mersereau, who with her mother journeyed from New York to Florida for the sole purpose of taking part in the making of this picture, is more than a dancer. That she has abundant talent for emotional portrayal will be evident to all those so fortunate as to see this subject. It is not alone in his careful, skillful treatment of tense dramatic situations that Mr. Vignola does praiseworthy work; we see plainly that he is an exponent of the best and truest in dramatic art, the restrained as opposed to the demonstrative. It is also in his selection and likewise construction of backgrounds that are artistic as well as convincing that go far toward the success of this fine picture. An illustration of this is the hut where lives the grass-skirted Sahki, or the theater stage, the drawing back of the velvet curtain of which reveals a jungled setting and the wild outdoors. Some of the best dramatic situations are of the notification of Richard of the death of his father; the bidding good-bye to the native wife; the meeting of Richard and Mabel; the dancing of Sahki on the theater stage, with Richard and Mabel in the box nearby; the discovery by Sahki of the husband, in search of whom she has come to America, and Richard's recognition of his wife; the self-destruction by the wife and the tragic scenes in the little dressing-room. It is about Sahki that will center the interest and the sympathy. Her graceful dancing will charm every audience. There is in it the light-hearted abandon, the naivete, of the child of the jungle, the freedom from the conventions of society, and, most important of all, the entire absence of the suggestive. Her work throughout, especially in the tragedy following the discovery of her husband, whets the curiosity to see her in straight work. - The Moving Picture World, April 18, 1914",United States,Robert G.

This photoplay is finely directed and contains many gripping scenes which hold the closest attention of the audience. Little Miss Wilson shows herself to be a fearless and excellent rider.

tt0003834,The Diamond of Disaster,1914.0,,,"Drama,Short","This picture, of which Phil Lonergan is the author and Carroll Fleming the director, will undoubtedly meet with a welcome reception wherever it is shown. The theme of the story is not a new one and it has been told several times before both in picture and in story, but there are some new twists to the present production that not only prove an alibi to any charge of plagiarism, but at the same time give it a novel shape and interest. As the picture was made in this country, a few of the scenes lack somewhat of the atmosphere of Hindustan or India in which all of the action takes place, but it is only the hypercritical who will notice them and the compelling interest of the story is bound to carry over the minor defects. The only real fault to be found with the picture is in the latter half of the story, where there are several leaders in succession all of them reading ""Later."" This should have been avoided as it gives a disagreeable impression that the story has been chopped and clipped and the incidents badly pieced together. Aside from this and the fact that some of the exteriors might have been better chosen, the picture is a ""real good show"" and is sure to please. One exceptionally meritorious thing about the picture is the Englishman's bungalow, which is a real house built in the studio yard in order that it might be blown up by the bandits. The interiors deserve all praise and with the exception that some of the palms were evidently potted plants, the exterior was a most creditable reproduction. The acting throughout was of a high order and especially noticeable was J.S. Murray as the Hindu merchant, Justus D. Barnes as the bandit, Ernest Ward as the fakir, Morgan Jones as the rajah, John Richards as Hassan, the rajah's captain, Muriel Ostriche as Zelda, the dancing girl, Irving Cummings as the Englishman; Carey L.

tt0003909,The Fable of the Brash Drummer and the Nectarine,1914.0,,,"Comedy,Short","The first of George Ade's Fables in Slang series. If judged by the first, the series promises to be exceedingly popular. For me ""The Fable of the Drummer and the Nectarine"" created gleeful chuckles all the way through. There was not a dull moment during the run of the film, and a thankful spirit prevailed for the absence of anything even remotely suggesting slap-stick business. Strong character drawing is a worthy feature of Mr. Ade's first film story, and the Essanay players sustain the parts admirably. The production is commendable for the strong atmosphere that is created and retained throughout. The small country town is just as real as if one were visiting in it, somewhere in Indiana. The corner grocery store, with the good-natured owner and the rustic loafers who traffic in the gossip of the village, is realistic to a dot. The arrival of the drummer is always a big feature for the gossiping loungers, and his display of liberality, in handing out cheap cigars or stuffing them into the months of the recipients, is in close keeping with his brash manners and superior city air. Wallace Beery plays the part with a fine sense of its requirements. He holds himself from outdoing the character, a something that he can place to his credit. Miss Beverly Bayne is at her best in the part of Clara Louise Willoughby, the modest village belle, or ""nectarine,"" as Mr. Ade jocosely brands her. The havoc wrought on the heart and hair of this shrinking beauty by the drummer, at his first meeting, will force a smile on the stoniest face. Miss Bayne's simulation of the girl's rustic manners and awkwardness stands out in strong contrast with her representation of the same girl after she has received a year's tuition in a finishing school for young ladies. Mr. Ade's definition of a ""finishing school,"" as seen in one of his sub-titles, is ""a place at which young ladies learn to give the quick finish to all persons who won't do."" The ""quick finish"" which the nectarine deals out to the drummer, as shown by Miss Bayne, is uproariously funny. As she resents his embraces by a vigorous display of athletic strength and then pours forth on his shrinking head the seven vials of a heated vocabulary, double exposure steps in to assist in the demolition of the unfortunate. We see him actually shrink up before her wrath and finally fade into thin air. The use of double exposure in this case affords one of the most laughable scenes I have viewed in many a day. It is scarcely necessary to remind viewers of this film to pay special heed to the sub-titles. Their quaint humor and slangy diction will make them pass muster as George Ade's own coinage. Nearly every one of them provokes a laugh. Take, for instance, this one: ""Deliver them, and just send the bill to father."" The nectarine has been out buying new hats, after several months' residence at the finishing school. The sub-title shows the ease with which she disposes of trifling things. When the ""old man"" gets the bill it amounts to over two hundred dollars! Here's another, describing the return of the nectarine to her village home after completing the course at the finishing school: ""When she landed back in the rube village, the natives took one look and got the blind staggers."" Contrast this with the description of her birthplace: ""Her birthplace was one spicy little burg. They took in the sidewalks at 9 o'clock each evening."" As the gabby salesman passes out of the life of the nectarine, Mr. Ade gives us the moral of the whole matter, thusly : ""Anybody can win unless there happens to be a second entry."" - The Moving Picture World, June 20, 1914",United States,George Ade,George Ade,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0003909/,short,1914,11

She, of course, decides he's guilty of something.George Ade, who wrote these ""Fables"" for Essanay, was an American newspaperman and humorist (sometimes it seems as if the two roles are indistinguishable). When I first encountered him fifty years ago, he had already sunk beneath general consciousness. If you wanted to read his ""Fables in Slang"", you had to go to Dover Press editions. There you would find little stories in which the English language had rolled up its sleeves, spat on its hands and gone to work.However there is nothing so dead as last generation's catchphrases, unless it is last month's Internet meme. Ade's language, as bright as it might have been in 1914, had only two places to go: it could 23 Skiddoo onto the junk heap, or become standard and unremarkable.Fortunately the story is a good one and the actors are also.

tt0003943,Fatty and Minnie He-Haw,1914.0,5.2,91,"Comedy,Short,Western","This is not a great piece of film comedy from Roscoe Arbuckle: good work, but not the eye-popping work he would do the following year. Nonetheless, there are a few good gags, particularly when he and Minnie and trying to kiss, but their bellies get in the way.Still, there is almost always something interesting in Arbuckle's work. First, I am struck by his characterization in the movie as cowardly and lecherous in a way that reminds me of Bob Hope's best work in the 1940s... which made me think of THE PALEFACE... Hope's version, not that of Arbuckle's pupil and friend, Buster Keaton.Second, this movie shows Arbuckle's wife, Minta Durfee, at her most adorable.Third, one piece of camera-work that I have never seen before: when Durfee, Arbuckle and Minnie move between the Indian camp and town, they are shown in distant silhouette: smaller than the way John Ford would typically shoot people but larger than, say, William Wyler would shoot people in THE BIG COUNTRY. Somehow, in this movie, this is irresistibly funny. I can't tell you why. If you can tell me, please do.",United States,Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0003943/,short,1914,20

tt0004030,Goodness Gracious,1914.0,8.8,21,"Comedy,Short","I laughed uproariously throughout this 1914 Vitagraph comedy, which deftly parodies the excesses of earlier film (and stage) melodramas. In the present day, there's an unfair perception that silent-film acting was exaggerated and lacking any subtlety. In fact, only a small minority of (mostly lesser) silent films are guilty of that charge. 'Goodness Gracious' features intentionally exaggerated acting and broadly improbable plot twists, clearly establishing that overripe acting and plot coincidences were already recognised as clichés as early as 1914.Clara Kimball Young, batting her eyelashes even faster than Bernadette Peters, plays Gwendoline, an innocent(?) heroine who seeks a livelihood in the big city. She's briefly employed in a 'bucket shop' (a crooked brokerage house) and arouses the attention of a moustache-twirling top-hatted villain (played by her real-life husband James Young). After temporarily escaping his clutches, she finds gainful employment in the firm of a dry-goods millionaire (James Lackaye). The millionaire's youthful son Cornelius (played by Sidney Drew, well into middle age) falls in love with her ... but his father disapproves of their marriage, and he cuts off Cornelius with only a shilling (24 cents, it says here in the titles). The villain arrives, murders Gwendoline's employer (just temporarily, mind you) and frames Cornelius for the crime. Will true love triumph?The film's plot is (intentionally) ridiculous, including a two-year jump in the action at one point. What makes this movie hilarious is the deft overplaying of all concerned, plus some incredibly broad sight gags. When Gwendoline strolls through the 'park', we see her standing in front of an obvious painted backdrop on an indoor stage. One of the trees is following her: the villain has got his own portable tree! This may be the cinema's earliest example of the gag (later used by Chaplin in 'Shoulder Arms') in which someone disguises himself as vegetation. This film also features one of the earliest movie appearances of Sherlock Holmes; here, he's the detective commanding a squadron of sub-Keystone Cops.Despite that one phony outdoor set, there are in fact some very interesting shots of rural Brooklyn here, including Sheepshead Bay. The movie climaxes with a spirited chase through a tenement, with most of the cast clambering in and out of a dumbwaiter shaft. (Anybody here remember dumbwaiter shafts? Modern audiences will wonder what that thing is.) There's a gag involving a Chinese laundryman that avoids the usual ethnic stereotypes. My only complaint about 'Goodness Gracious' is that the film places a lot of emphasis on undercranking, to speed up the action. I've never understood why an action that isn't funny in itself is supposed to become funny just by speeding up. Fortunately, the acting, the scriptwriting, and the gag titles in 'Goodness Gracious' are extremely funny, and I'll rate this delightful comedy 9 out of 10.",United States,James Young,J.

She changes her mind before it is too late and returns to her husband who welcomes her back while he shoots the man who tried to steal her from him. The photography is particularly to be commended. - The Moving Picture World, January 10, 1914",United States,Wallace Reid,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0004161/,short,1914,

From the films it appears that an association of cut-throats and highwaymen was in the habit of meeting in a notorious resort named ""The Kangaroo."" Here they either gambled or planned the commission of crimes against property and against the person. There is a love story interwoven with the tale of outrage and murder. After all the ""villians"" get their just deserts, there is a happy wedding. Much might be said in praise of some of the out-door settings, which were well chosen and helped to create the old New Orleans and Old South atmosphere. Considerable pains seem to have been taken in the staging of the interiors. The costumes were correct and no expense seems to have been spared in this respect. The acting was good on the whole.

He's got a lot of issues with one of their neighbors, in the person of Paul Panzer, who keeps threatening war. He takes a holiday, traveling incognito through his country. He settles at an inn where Eleanor Woodruff and her parents run the shop; her brother, an army man is at home recuperating from an injury. Cummings and Miss Woodruff fall in love, and her brother threatens him for not having honorable intentions. At that moment, Cummings' aide shows up, tells everyone who he is -- much bowing and scraping -- and tells Cummings that his counselors have decided he must marry a foreign princess to shut Panzer up.In the next scene, Panzer shows up at the inn to meet with traitors who are selling him war plans. Miss Woodruff overhears him. A foofaraw ensues and Panzer is killed in self-defense. But although the innocent are not punished, Panzer's nation declares war, and guess where the national command staff sets up shop for the great battle?It's directed by Oscar Apfel. He gave up directing when sound came in and was a respected supporting player. Despite directing almost 120 features, his is primary known for having been co-director on Cecil B. Demille's first few features. Supposedly Apfel was along just to do the technical camera stuff until Demille figured it out. This work shows him as a very competent director. It's a bit old fashioned in that it uses the ""illustrated text"" technique -- tell the audience what they're about to see, and then the players act it out -- but the big scenes are well done, the stories flow well, and the acting is pretty good for 1914. I have some issues with the fact that everyone shows up at the same inn, but that was how they did it, instead of showing how Miss Woodruff kept coincidentally being where the action is.

Some prettily comic incidents occur in the opening of the story, which later merges into the near tragic when the school takes fire and Paul, previously locked up by his teacher for misconduct, is forgotten. This latter incident is the beginning of the end when the sweethearts decide to patch up a quarrel which has taken place between them.

Some roughs determine to levy a generous contribution on him for a revolution, and land on the island. The girl's lover had been coming there, but had been ""warned"" off. He now, with the help of Muriel, is able to save the treasure and win the father's consent. The staging and photography are of the best. It is played naturally.

tt0004243,The Little Teacher,1915.0,5.0,74,"Comedy,Short","Most of the Mack Sennett productions of the 1910s were made by the seat of their pants. In other words, there were seldom scripts...just a basic story idea...and the actors were told to 'act funny'. Winging it sometimes worked well...often it didn't and Sennett's later films, which were scripted, are generally much better. So, the fact that ""The Little Teacher"" actually seems to have a coherent plot and not just people bonking each other makes it unusual for this period. While I would certainly applaud this, there is a minor problem...the film forgot to be funny. Now the antics of the 'kids' in this schoolroom comedy were supposed to be funny and perhaps were seen that way in 1915, but when seen today it all seems pretty limp....plus you question how anyone would think who actors (Sennett himself and Fatty Arbuckle) would be perceived at kids when they were 35 and 28 respectively! And, sadly, the leading lady (Mabel Normand) just seems lost most of the time with little to do. A clear misfire.",United States,Mack Sennett,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0004243/,short,1915,21

In these characters there is a good deal that is distinctly foreign and it passes for Japanese. Bertie Fitcarin and William Taylor play the Americans, The story is fresh and clearly pictured, but few will count it a powerful one, although there are two distinctly sensational incidents. The lack of power comes not from improbability so much as from lack of liveliness in the characters. The photography serves. It was written by W.E. Wing and produced by U.

What is of interest is that Roscoe Arbuckle directed it without credit; he co-starred himself and his real life wife, Minta Durfee; his rival is his nephew, Al St. John and Arbuckle's dog Luke has his screen premiere. Luke would appear in a baker's dozen movies over the next half dozen years to good effect.Given that Arbuckle was already turning out some spiffy movies (particularly in combination with Mabel Normand), I can only conclude that it took Miss Normand or a shooting trip to the East to reduce producer Mack Sennett's influence.",United States,Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0004268/,short,1914,

There have been others pictures of Indian brutality, but here, although Uncle Sam's soldiers come to the rescue in time to save husband and wife, these have lost everything and almost their faith in God. The picture gives four reels without a touch of romance; there was none to give. The author is Dot Farley who plays the leading woman's role well. The director is G.P. Hamilton.

It has for its theme the theft of a play from a starving man, and is very much like a two reel number entitled ""The Sword of Damocles,"" put out by the Pathe company, as we recall it. The story is a gripping one and well-pictured and nicely handled. Marc McDermott is strong as the real playwright and Duncan McRae and Gertrude McCoy play the remaining leads.

tt0004301,Man of the Hour,1914.0,6.0,16,Drama,"This picture is a photo dramatization of the famous play by George Broadhurst dealing with modern political corruption, and is the fourth of the William A. Brady features to be released by the World Film Corporation. That it will meet with the success of its original on the legitimate stage there can hardly be any doubt. Not only is the picture story equally forcible and true to life as the stage version, but the picture allows of many little bits of characterization and detail, necessarily omitted before the footlights, that greatly enhance the human heart interest of the story and bring before us most vividly the reality of the characters as human beings. The actors from Robert Warwick, who created the part and plays the central character in both play and photodrama, down to the sneak thief, butlers, aldermen and other supers, have made the most of their opportunity in a very intelligent and gratifying way and except on rare occasions make us forget that they are actors and actresses. Especially good are Ned Burton as the corrupt political boss, Eric Mayne as the unscrupulous financier and false friend, Alec B. Francis as the trusting and ruined father of the ""man of the hour,"" and Belle Adair as the heroine. Mention should also be made of the two western characters: Chester Barrett as the hero's ""pal"" and Thomas Jackson as the sheriff. The exteriors are very well chosen and some of them are extremely beautiful. The interiors are also noteworthy for their fidelity to the atmosphere and tone of the story and especially remarkable are the convention hall where the man of the hour makes his campaign speech and the council room of the board of aldermen where the fight on the franchise bill is played. Political plays as a rule have on the screen a farcical element due to the fact that the settings in which they are played are manifestly unreal. The undoubted genuineness of the settings in ""The Man of the Hour"" eliminate this element and force home to the spectator in a most telling way the reality of what is being enacted. - Moving Picture World, October 24, 1914",United States,Maurice Tourneur,George Broadhurst,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0004301/,movie,1914,50

tt0004319,McVeagh of the South Seas,1914.0,4.9,54,Drama,"Very few of the people reviewing this film seem to properly take into account how early it is. They talk blithely about ""silent films set in the South Seas"" although they would be hard put to find another of this date. If they have a long list of ""South Sea"" films made in or around 1914, perhaps they would like to post it somewhere because they evidently know something I do not know. Although in its existing print it has evidently been re-edited for its 1922 re-release, it is basically a film of 1914 - made that is to say before D. W. Griffith had made any full-length film except the dire Home Sweet Home and the indifferent Judith of Bethulia. This film also compares favourably with D. W. Griffith's own perfectly dreadful South Seas films of 1920 (The Idol Dancer and The Love Flower). Stylistically it is for that matter more sophisticated than The Birth of a Nation.So, while it is true that this film contains all the typical elements of LATER South Seas films (particularly in fact the cult-horror films of the fifties) although not really the ""paradisal"" elements (which only come in after Flahert'y 1926 Moana), it is actually in the process not of copying those clichés (except in so far as thy exist as literary tropes) but of crating them.Its principal weakness not in the acting or the direction which are as good as anything produced in the US at this date - one can find many much better European films in 1914 - except perhaps Tourneur's The Wishing Ring (it does not compare unfavourably, for instance, with the original version of The Squaw Man or any of the surviving DeMille films of 1914) but in the writing, which is rather trashy. Here Carey would have been wise to take a leaf out of Hobart Bosworth's book and seek out strong scripts with a certain literary quality (alas his Martin Eden of this year only seems to survive in an incomplete copy).

Miss Viola Dana makes a delicious boy; she looks palatable, but how the officers are deceived into believing her to be the real thing will probably remain one of those profound mysteries which have baffled men of recondite erudition in all ages. She learns to drum by the womanly way, by intuition; she doesn't need any practice, and she is accepted at once as a member of that desperate band of soldiers from whom our Daughters of the Revolution and Colonial Dames are so proudly descended. She has hardly started before George Washington, the general, not the austere statesman and profound thinker described in history, assigns the drummer boy to a duty of great peril and high importance. Washington, pre-eminent among his contemporaries for great dignity, quite as much as for more splendid qualities, is represented by Ogle as naturally inclined to be a hail-fellow-well-met. The general who compelled the surrender of Cornwallis was as dignified in the field as while establishing the machinery of government, yet he becomes enthusiastic over an unwounded drummer boy, ""wishes to see him immediately"" and extends ""the thanks of Continental Congress."" When the war is over, comment is superfluous. Miss Dana does well enough to deserve a better role and the treatment of the story is all that could be given it. Actress and director did their best with material of very small value. Such plays are below the Edison standard of other years, and far below the best work of this year. - The Moving Picture World, June 20, 1914",United States,George Lessey,Harriet T.

That leading idea involves so much relating to the use and abuse of wealth that it belongs less to the material realm of action than to the spiritual one of laying bare man's soul. The secret purpose of the plot is to open up wide opportunity for sensational development, and. as might be expected, events follow lines of least resistance, but there is far less falsification of character for the sake of thrilling incident than in most plays of this kind.

The titular role is taken by Mae Marsh, who is not quite so sure in her portrayal as usual, not on account of limited imagination but from lack of human experience not astonishing in one of her years. For instance, she puts a touch to Miss Tichner's kind of work in it at one place and one can catch several changes of tone in Molly that spoil her consistency.

What is missing is movement within the frame,  the sophisticated complication of action that Griffith understood and which the unnamed director and cameraman did not, and the sense that the story is about more than story.   As a result, it winds up looking like Griffith's work from 1909, and unremarkable Griffith from that period.That being the case, this is a technically interesting movie, since it underscores what Griffith understood about film making that his contemporaries did not.
